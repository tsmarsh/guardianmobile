She said the report, carried out by Ofsted inspectors and used by Balls in support of his ­decision to remove her, was misleading and lacked balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She accused Balls directly of making the task of protecting children in Haringey more difficult. The consequences of his "reckless" attack on Haringey, said Shoesmith, would be to make it "more of an uphill struggle" to achieve his aim of raising the standing and status of the social work profession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she also admits that she and the council were unprepared for the scale of public anger when details of the Baby P case emerged. "We were out of touch with public opinion," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baby P was 17 months old when he died after suffering more than 50 injuries at the hands of his abusive mother, 27, her boyfriend, 32, and their lodger, Jason Owen, 36, despite 60 contacts with the authorities over eight months. They are due to be sentenced next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interview, Shoesmith reveals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• She and her team of social workers had been deeply shocked by Baby P's death. She regrets that the "disastrous" press conference called in November to present details of the case following the conviction of Baby P's killers wrongly created the perception that she was not prepared to apologise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Some errors were made in what was an exceptionally complex and difficult case, but she stands by her decision to discipline rather than sack three employees involved in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• At times during the crisis she contemplated suicide in despair at the way she was hounded by tabloid newspapers. She received death threats and hundreds of abusive texts from members of the public, and was forced to take special police protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• She understood why people were appalled by the circumstances of Baby P's death, but there was a desperate need for a more mature debate about the difficulty of child protection work, and more realistic expectations from the government and the media about the ability of safeguarding agencies to prevent all child deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoesmith, 55, who is considering legal action for unfair dismissal after being formally sacked by Haringey on 8 December without notice or compensation, says she had the support of her employers but she accepts that the strength of media pressure on the council in the end made her position intolerable. "I was squashed between politics and the press."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says one of her biggest regrets was the damage caused to Haringey over the affair. She is angry Ofsted told Balls on 1 December that the failings it identified in Haringey were "exceptional" when it knew that a number of councils around the country were struggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haringey children's services had received a "good" annual assessment by Ofsted three months after Baby P died. Shoesmith rejects suggestions, made by Ofsted chief Christine Gilbert in a Guardian interview in December, that Haringey had given inspectors false data to achieve a "good" annual assessment in November 2007. "I deeply objected to being called deceitful in the press ... [when] I was completely unable to defend myself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoesmith says the Ofsted inquiry was misleading because it suggested she faced a conflict of interests because she was chair of the local safeguarding children board investigating the Baby P case when it was accepted at the time that 70% of all such boards in England at the time were chaired by the children's directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also believes it was wrong to allow her a chance to respond before publication or to imply Haringey had a particular problem with heavy child protection caseloads and high reliance on agency staff when these difficulties were common in most deprived inner-city boroughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haringey's performance and reputation had been improving in recent years following reforms and a renewed focus on child protection following a national outcry over the death of Victoria Climbié in the borough in 2000, she says. But this had been put at risk because the press condemnation of social workers was ­destroying morale and fuelling a recruitment crisis , she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian revealed last month that the new children's director in Haringey, Peter Lewis, had to appeal to neighbouring boroughs to lend staff because of shortages of personnel skilled in carrying out child protection investigations. There is also anecdotal evidence that councils have seen a rise in the number of care proceedings which could result in youngsters being taken from their family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoesmith reveals that friends had advised her to find another job after the death of Baby P in August 2007 because it was likely to be a difficult case to handle. But she turned down job offers to  see the job through: "That was the weakest thing I could do. That [would have been] betrayal – that I could walk away from the council and leave them to handle this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed Balls said last night: "I make no apology for the actions I took in Haringey last December, which I judged absolutely necessary to make sure children in that borough are properly protected.  I believe that every community, every parent and every social worker would expect me to put the safety of children first. That is what I did - and faced with the same situation again I would have no hesitation in taking exactly the same decisions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/baby-p"&gt;Baby P&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/childprotection"&gt;Child protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/edballs"&gt;Ed Balls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/childrensministry"&gt;Children's ministry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/localgovernment"&gt;Local government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>HBOS staff received goodbyes in cash</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/feb/07/hbos-executive-salaries-lloyds-tsb</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/49464?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Business%3A+Disgraced+HBOS+bankers+received+their+goodbyes+in+cash&amp;ch=Business&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=HBOS+%28Business%29%2CExecutive+salaries+%28Business%29%2CLloyds+Banking+Group+%28Business%29%2CBanking+%28Business%29%2CCredit+crunch+%28Business%29%2CBusiness&amp;c5=Investments%2CCredit+Crunch%2CBusiness+Markets&amp;c6=Jill+Treanor&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1165135&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Business&amp;c12=HBOS&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FBusiness%2FHBOS" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disgraced banking boardroom executives at HBOS walked away with cash payments worth hundreds of thousands of pounds each, the Guardian has learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives were handed the cash after HBOS was rescued by Lloyds TSB and the takeover formally activated a "change of control" clause in their contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to hand over the cash will fuel a mounting row over the pay of bankers in institutions being bailed out with taxpayer funds. There is growing speculation in Westminster that the government will be forced to follow Barack Obama in the US and impose pay restrictions on bank executives who have sought bailouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes as millions of pounds of bonuses are about to be paid to employees who remain at Royal Bank of Scotland.  The cash payments at HBOS were made at the discretion of the bank, which has received &amp;pound;11bn of taxpayer funds and been folded into the Lloyds Banking Group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is understood to have allowed share-based performance schemes to pay out in cash rather than shares. Such schemes might more ordinarily roll into the shares of the new company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The directors are thought to have received 10% of the value of the shares at the time they were granted, rather than their current value. Some of the shares were granted at &amp;pound;11 but were valued at less than 70p when the rescue takeover went through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chief executive, Andy Hornby, was quick to refuse any contractual payoffs he was entitled to when he was ousted by the Lloyds management, shareholders will be incensed to learn that he was in line to receive other cash payments. Hornby may have received around &amp;pound;250,000 as a result of the share schemes being cashed in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also emerged that some boardroom directors took contractual payoffs.  Peter Cummings, the long-standing executive who ran the corporate bank which has run up vast losses, is understood to have held the bank to his contractual terms. He was entitled to one year's salary - in 2007 he earned &amp;pound;600,000 before &amp;pound;1.6m of bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HBOS declined to comment on details of its pay schemes. A spokesman said: "We never comment on individual remuneration arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a matter of law that employees at every level have a legal right to their contractual entitlements. HBOS would be no different to any other company on that point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank made its decision knowing that Hornby and his boardroom colleagues had ploughed all of their cash bonuses in to the bank's shares - and had seen their value wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thousands of HBOS staff who have bought shares through save-as-you-earn schemes are thought to have had their investments rolled over into shares in the new Lloyds bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/hbos"&gt;HBOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/executivesalaries"&gt;Executive salaries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/lloydstsbgroup"&gt;Lloyds Banking Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking"&gt;Banking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/credit-crunch"&gt;Credit crunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Brown's VAT cut a mistake - Sarkozy</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/07/sarkozy-brown-vat-cut</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/27900?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=World+news%3A+Brown%27s+VAT+cut+was+a+mistake%2C+says+Sarkozy&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Nicolas+Sarkozy+%28News%29%2CGordon+Brown%2CEconomic+policy%2CGlobal+economy+%28Business%29%2CGlobal+recession%2CCredit+crunch+%28Business%29%2CForeign+policy%2CFrance%2CWorld+news%2CPolitics%2CUK+news&amp;c5=Credit+Crunch%2CPolicy+Society%2CBusiness+Markets%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Allegra+Stratton%2CIan+Traynor&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1165138&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=World+news&amp;c12=Nicolas+Sarkozy&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FWorld+news%2FNicolas+Sarkozy" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relations between Britain and France nose-dived yesterday after the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, branded Gordon Brown's economic rescue plan a failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarkozy's praise for his own policies and criticism of others also sparked outrage in the Czech Republic, currently holding the EU presidency, where the French leader was accused of protectionism, helping to wreck the European economy, and  "deconstructing" the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a lengthy live television interview, Sarkozy called Brown's VAT cut a "mistake" that had "absolutely not worked", while defending his decision to reflate the French economy with greater spending on infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Britain is cutting taxes. That will bring them nothing. Consumption continues to decrease in Britain ... if anything, consumption has gone down," Sarkozy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downing Street was not impressed. A spokesman said: "The Elys&amp;eacute;e have been in contact this morning to assure us that these remarks were not meant as a critique of UK economic policy - which is nice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was no urgency to repair any damage, with an Elys&amp;eacute;e spokesman saying that Brown and Sarkozy would have a chance to discuss their different approaches at a summit to be held in Berlin in the next fortnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the British quietly fumed, the Czechs were furious after Sarkozy lambasted French carmakers' operations outside France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When a manufacturer - I won't name names - sets up a factory in the Czech Republic to sell cars to French people, that's unjustified," Sarkozy argued in flat contradiction of Europe's single market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Czechs took over the six-monthly EU presidency from the French this month, with Sarkozy clearly loth to surrender the position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a highly unusual row between two consecutive EU presidencies, the Czech prime minister, Mirek Topolanek, accused Sarkozy of undermining the single market. "The attempts to use the financial crisis to introduce such forms of protectionism may slow down and threaten the revival of the European economy," he declared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarkozy is under pressure after hundreds of thousands of French people took part in strikes over concerns that the president is putting business before ordinary workers and failing to protect jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday the Dutch finance minister, Wouter Bos, the country's Labour party leader, described Brown's VAT cut as "not a very wise thing to do", adding: "I don't believe it will contribute to a recovery of the economy, whereas it does put pressure on other countries to do the same."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday a Downing Street spokesman said: "The point about VAT, as we have said all along, is that [the cut] will run for a year, so it is too early to judge the effect it has had ... we have set out quite clearly the case for the VAT cut and all along we have said that other countries must take what measures are appropriate for their own economic circumstances."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government was criticised by opposition politicians and some businesses after announcing a temporary cut in VAT from 17.5% to 15% in November to galvanise high street spending. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December the German finance minister, Peer Steinbr&amp;uuml;ck of the Social Democrats, warned his country against following the UK's "crass Keynsianism".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nicolas-sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/gordon-brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy"&gt;Economic policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/global-economy"&gt;Global economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/globalrecession"&gt;Global recession&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/credit-crunch"&gt;Credit crunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/foreignpolicy"&gt;Foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/france"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

Oh God, Meredith!" rang out when the bloodied and lifeless body of the British student Meredith Kercher was found lying on the floor of her bedroom, an Italian court was told yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A police officer, Fabio Marzi, was describing the scene in the instant after a friend of one of Kercher's Italian flatmates broke down the locked door of her room, shortly after one o'clock on the afternoon of 2 November 2007. Her former boyfriend told the court later: "There was blood and a foot sticking out from under the duvet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their testimony was given on a day of high drama in the murder trial of Kercher's American flatmate, Amanda Knox, and Knox's Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His voice shaking with emotion, Sollecito told the court he had no idea why he was there and would "not harm a fly". The 24-year-old computer sciences graduate was taking advantage of his right under Italian law to make a spontaneous declaration at any point in his trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third person, Rudy Guede, an Ivory Coast-born drifter, has been convicted of the killing which the prosecution claims was carried out by all three - Guede, Knox and Sollecito - because Kercher refused to join them in an orgy of sex and drugs. Guede opted for a fast-track trial and was given a 30-year jail sentence last October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to talk about the situation in which I find myself, which is very unreal. It is so strange," the bespectacled Sollecito began, before his voice wavered for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have been in prison for a year and three months. But I have nothing to do with this situation. I am not a violent person and it has never entered my mind to kill anyone. Anyone who knows me will tell you I wouldn't harm a fly. I don't know why I'm in this situation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "I barely knew Meredith. I didn't know Guede at all." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sollecito, wearing a pale roll-neck sweater, said he had begun a romance with Amanda Knox a week before Kercher's death, on 25 October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no understanding such as to allow me to do who knows what," he said before his voice faltered again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I regard myself as the victim of a judicial error," Sollecito finished, before resuming his place between his lawyers in the frescoed underground courtroom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knox, dressed in a bottle-green sweater, had earlier taken her place a few feet away, looking relaxed and apparently in good spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of Washington student turned, smiled and waved to her father, Curt, who was sitting at the back of the court. Talking to reporters later, her father was overcome with emotion after being asked how it felt to watch his daughter sitting through a trial for murder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knox said that contradictions had already emerged in the evidence that would lead to her acquittal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the proceedings got under way, the young American student listened to the witnesses' testimony earnestly, staring ahead impassively as an interpreter whispered a translation in her ear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sollecito, almost as pale as his sweater, looked less composed, and frequently shot hunted glances at the court officials and rows of reporters lined up behind him. Yesterday was the first day of evidence, but it opened with a sometimes passionate exchange between the defence and prosecution lawyers over the admissibility as evidence of a note written by Knox on 6 November, shortly after her formal arrest at noon. The note repeated parts of a statement she made hours earlier, at 5.45am, which has been ruled inadmissible by Italy's highest appeals court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her statement was made without the assistance of either a lawyer or a professional interpreter, and the defence has argued that Knox was confused, frightened and being asked to sign a statement in a language in which she was far from fluent. But the note she subsequently wrote was in English, and the prosecution said it was clearly made voluntarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Knox's defence lawyers took advantage of the dispute to tell the court that 36 police officers had been present when the then 20-year-old Knox was told she was under arrest for murder. For greater effect, he read out their names one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manuela Comodi, for the prosecution, acknowledged that the entire mobile patrols unit of Perugia police had been there. But she said that was "because the entire mobile patrols squad had taken part in the investigation of this very serious, bloody crime. It does not mean that there was physical aggression or mobbing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge overruled the objection and admitted the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the court heard yesterday, Kercher's body was discovered in a curious way. Police went to the house she shared with Knox and two young Italian women after being called by a neighbour, who had discovered the British student's mobile in her garden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the house, the police found Knox and Sollecito, and one of the issues in contention yesterday was whether Sollecito had called for help before their arrival, as he claimed, or after. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were joined at the scene by one of the Italian flatmates and three of her friends, including the young man who broke down the door. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial is expected to last until at least the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/meredithkercher"&gt;Meredith Kercher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Vatican crisis over Holocaust denier</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/07/vatican-pope-holocaust-bishop</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/4888?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=World+news%3A+Vatican+crisis+over+bishop+who+denies+the+Holocaust&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Pope+Benedict+XVI%2CHolocaust+%28News%29%2CCatholicism+%28News%29%2CJudaism+%28News%29%2CReligion+%28News%29%2CSecond+world+war+%28News%29%2CWorld+news&amp;c5=Unclassified%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=John+Hooper%2CRiazat+Butt&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1165144&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=World+news&amp;c12=Pope+Benedict+XVI&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FWorld+news%2FPope+Benedict+XVI" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only birdsong and muttered prayers disturb the tranquil cloisters where men dressed in long, black cassocks make their way to daily mass said in Latin; seminary students with hoes tend the vegetable allotments and check the wooden beehives that shelter beneath a copse of pine trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the neo-classical seminary of Our Lady of Corredentora, set in open countryside in the peaceful outskirts of Buenos Aires, is at the eye of a storm that stretches all the way to the gates of the Vatican.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past five years, Bishop Richard Williamson has presided over this ultra-conservative religious community in La Reja, but the man behind the international uproar is not receiving visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neighbours note that padlocks have appeared on the seminary gates. The weekday handouts of food to the local community have also been temporarily suspended, "for summer recess" according to a sign on the administrator's door. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bishop Williamson is busy with "spiritual exercises", a cassocked novice in the seminary compound told the Guardian. "The seminary is closed for a month-long spiritual retreat and no contact is permitted during this time." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversial British cleric certainly does not seem about to break his quasi-monastic routine to answer Pope Benedict's request for clarification of his comments on the Holocaust, which surfaced this week shortly after the Vatican's decision to welcome back into the church four excommunicated bishops, including Williamson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe there were no gas chambers," Williamson said in an interview with Swedish television last month, claiming that no more than 300,000 Jews died in concentration camps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, a source close to the highest levels in the Vatican told the Guardian, "the biggest catastrophe for the Roman Catholic church in modern times". An exaggeration, perhaps, but the passion with which that judgment was spat out hinted at the tensions that have been aroused by Pope Benedict's move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His judgment and ability have been questioned as never before, both within his administration, the Roman Curia, and the wider church that he leads. It has unleashed a torrent of Jewish indignation, doubtless setting back the chances of a deal on the status of the Roman Catholic church in Israel, and could yet doom his scheduled visit to the Holy Land in May. Some of the fiercest internal criticism came, not from the dwindling numbers of liberal Catholics, but from the very conservatives who delighted in his election four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benedict came to the papal throne as the "law and order" candidate. "The aim of his pontificate has been to restore order to the Catholic church after the tumultuous innovations of the previous incumbent," said Luigi Accattoli, Vatican commentator for Corriere della Sera. "Many of those innovations, particularly with regard to interfaith dialogue and ecumenism, were not always well-received."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was consistent with his objective that Benedict should have set out to end the Catholic church's only modern schism, formalised in 1988 when Pope John Paul II excommunicated four clerics belonging to the ultra-conservative Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX). The four, who included Williamson, had all been ordained as bishops by the rebel SSPX's founder, Marcel Lefebvre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reincorporating the diehards was never going to be easy. Williamson is far from being the only member of the SSPX to question the extent of the Nazi Holocaust. Father Floriano Abrahamowicz told the Tribuna di Treviso, a newspaper in north-east Italy, this week: "I know the gas chambers existed - at least, for disinfecting - but not whether they caused deaths or not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far as church unity is concerned, however, it is their theological insubordination that is more relevant. The SSPX was created to provide a spiritual home for those Catholics who refused to accept the liberal reforms of the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65. While many of its innovations have since been interpreted in a restrictive fashion, not least by Benedict, they remain fundamental to any definition of modern Catholicism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by lifting the excommunications without demanding any undertaking from Williamson and the others, the pope has angered not just liberals, who see it as capitulation to an unpleasantly reactionary splinter group, but also the many conservatives who admired his insistence on obedience and who feel he has blunted the most fearsome disciplinary instrument in the pope's gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few, in Rome at least, were ready to vent their criticism publicly. But according to one well-informed source, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the senior Vatican official who was told to sign the decree lifting the excommunications on behalf of the pope, "roared" his disapproval of the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defenders of the initiative noted that the decree did not, of itself, heal the schism or settle the issue of the SSPX's future status within the Catholic church. The announcement said it was issued out of "paternal pity".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What Benedict has said is that this is the first step in a dialogue," acknowledged a prominent British liberal speaking on condition of anonymity. "But that could be very bad for the church as a whole. It is one thing if [the Lefebvrists] come nearer to the church universal. But if the church universal comes closer to them, it matters a great deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some German and Austrian clerics, appalled by Williamson's claim that "only" 300,000 Jews had been exterminated by the Nazis, made their objections clear. But there was also said to be seething discontent in the French church, which has borne the brunt of Lefebvre's rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to one source in Rome, a delegation of French bishops was expected at the Vatican next week to protest that they were not consulted on the move. Similar complaints were being aired within the Vatican itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time Williamson's remarks were broadcast, on 21 January, the decree had already been signed. But had the Vatican's media experts been consulted, they might have suggested freezing the announcement until the British bishop withdrew his remarks - or at least until after the United Nations Holocaust memorial day on 27 January. "Benedict's inner circle needs to have someone who is sensitive to public opinion and can see these problems coming," said the pope's biographer, John Allen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in La Reja, Sabina Medina, a resident who wakes up to the seminary bells at 6am every day, shares the shock that many in the local community feel about Williamson's statement about the Holocaust. "You can't call yourself a real Catholic and hold such absurd views. I'm not certain about his place on Judgment Day," the 52-year-old says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the seminary's arched entrance gates, the telephone receptionist arrives for work. Liliana, 53, is a faithful attendant at the seminary's Sunday mass and a firm defender of Bishop Williamson, arguing that his comments were taken out of context. Once at her desk, a quiet day lies ahead of her. The very week that the world is watching and waiting, it seems the seminary's telephone line has providentially gone down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Profile&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Converted to Catholicism in 1971. Later joined the Society of St Pius X (SSPX) and ordained a priest by Archbishop Lefebvre in 1976. Consecrated as bishop without the Vatican's permission he was summarily excommunicated in 1988. Continued his work with SSPX in Argentina, becoming a cult figure among far-right seminarians. On Swedish TV last year he said that no Jews had died in gas chambers. He has also claimed that the US government planned 9/11 and that a Jewish conspiracy to achieve world domination is very real. He says women can be distracted by having their own ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pope-benedict-xvi"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/holocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/catholicism"&gt;Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/judaism"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion"&gt;Religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/secondworldwar"&gt;Second world war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/58642?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Society%3A+%27When+a+dead+child+is+known+to+us%2C+that%27s+the+biggest+horror.+We+knew+the+size+of+that%27&amp;ch=Society&amp;c3=guardian.co.uk&amp;c4=Baby+P%2CEd+Balls%2CChild+protection+%28Society%29%2CLocal+government+%28Society%29%2CChildren%27s+ministry%2CUK+news%2CSociety%2CPolitics%2CEducation&amp;c5=Society+Weekly%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CEducation+Weekly+Education%2CLocal+Government+Society%2CSchools+Education%2CChildren+Society&amp;c6=Aida+Edemariam&amp;c7=2009_02_06&amp;c8=1165114&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Society&amp;c12=Baby+P&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FSociety%2FBaby+P" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Sharon Shoesmith heard of Baby P was when her deputy came into her office on 3 August 2007 and told her a child was dead. This in itself was not unusual – she was informed every time there was a child death in the borough. "So even at the weekends I would sometimes get a message to say three-year-old died not known to us, two-year-old, 16-year-old not known to us. But when you get a child who's died is known to us, is on our at risk register, that's the biggest horror that could have been and we knew the size of that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon Shoesmith has not changed her appearance, as some might expect her to have done since she was dismissed as Haringey council's director of children's services last year: she still has short, dark hair above heavy designer glasses, and, apart from dropping them a few times, and apart from a sudden snag into tears, she is very composed, very still. She called the leader of the council, who was on holiday. Not much needed to be said. They both knew the gravity of what they were dealing with. She decided not to call Liz Santry, the council cabinet member for children, who was also on holiday, and immediately regretted that when Santry found out on the news, because someone had leaked the nature of Baby P's injuries to the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the information related to the case was immediately put in a secure room. The social worker was told, as was Ofsted, and every child on the at-risk register was looked at again. She says she could have left right then; she was being headhunted for chief executive jobs elsewhere. But "I always, always, always felt that that was the last thing that I was going to do. That that was the weakest thing that I could do. That was betrayal, to walk away from the council and leave them to handle this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also says that in an organisation just regaining its morale after the Victoria Climbié case, she could not afford to panic. "Other social workers knew the size of this and if you're not careful you begin to lose your staff and the department could go into meltdown basically, and could go into being a very unsafe place." She knew the drill: a couple of internal reviews were commissioned, one general, and one about compliance with the Laming recommendations after the death of Victoria Climbié. A serious case review was also begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoesmith, who is from Newtownabbey, Co Antrim, began working with children when she was 15, helping in a residential home for special needs children. She left Northern Ireland when she was 20, after she was caught in a bombing of the Europa hotel, and worked as a special needs teacher, then as a director of special needs support services, and then as an Ofsted inspector, all over England. She was hired to run Haringey's educational service, a job at which, according to an open letter later signed by 61 headteachers, she was "outstanding". The next step up was an entirely new job in 2005, created by the Children Act 2004, which after the Victoria Climbié inquiry recommended that education and safeguarding be combined to increase communication between the two. "Professionally I felt that I'd waited 30years for it, so I was very, very fired up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The job came with a budget of £100m, a staff of nearly 3,500, and some very specific challenges, among which was no official provision for training in the safeguarding aspect. Many directors, Shoesmith says, had to organise their own training, in education if they were from a social work background, and social work if they were from education. There was the so-called "Climbié bulge", of many more children than usual taken into care; there was also a new, post-Climbié IT system. The independent Ofsted report would later criticise her department for excessive box-ticking, and emphasis on numbers and targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says she was always worried that social workers were spending 70% of their time in front of computers instead of with families, although she didn't pass this worry on to her superiors; as for targets, if she didn't meet them, it had a direct effect on her budget, which was already forcing her to get rid of staff ‑ from management, she insists, not the frontline. Were there any complaints about her performance? "Never. Never."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspections in 2005 were positive; two reviews were overall good, and adequate for social care: "We put that right, they pointed out some issues. In my own performance I had very positive appraisals every single year and those are all on record."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The October, after Baby P died, Ofsted gave Haringey a three-star rating out of four, saying it provided a good service for children, although it was later pointed out in parliament that this inspection had been carried out by a former employee of Shoesmith's, and was based on desk research. Much would later be made, by ministers, and press, and in the final Ofsted report, of the fact that she chaired the serious case review, and that this was a conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoesmith is outraged by the suggestion. "It is on record that some 70%-plus of directors of children's services chaired their local safeguarding children boards and if you look at London, I'm told at the time of Baby P's death only seven of the 32 local authorities had an independent chair … So yes I chaired it and there's absolutely nothing unusual about that anywhere in the country." The two independent writers of the serious case review looked into much of the information that has since been made public: that Baby P first came to the notice of a social worker in 2006, when "all the action that was taken was absolutely correct" (a quote Shoesmith says was then taken to be her opinion on the entire process, which was not the case); that twice social workers sought legal advice about taking him into care, and twice were advised that the threshold had not been met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one knew, until Baby P died, that there were two men in the flat, because there was no trace of them, even on repeated, unannounced visits. Social workers believed they were dealing with a chaotic single mother who was honestly worried about a child she kept voluntarily bringing in for medical assessments. Shoesmith says it has since emerged that she mentioned a boyfriend in a parenting class – but the class regarded that information as confidential, and it was not passed on. But she knows that there doesn't need to be an obvious perpetrator for a child to be taken into care, and there were other things at work. In April 2007 bruising and swelling on Baby P's head was diagnosed as possible meningitis; in June bruising to the face prompted arrangements for a family friend to supervise his care. The weekend before Baby P died he stayed with his natural father, who reported no concerns. Two days before he died, a paediatrician missed a broken back. The day before he died, police "saw the mother with the social worker and said there was no evidence to press any charges". They told the social workers to go ahead and organise a short holiday for her. "I was in the room when the police came to tell some of those staff that she had been charged with murder and I'll remember the scene for ever because they simply couldn't believe it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the huge learning issues I think that comes out of this is they were operating this rule of optimism, that this mother was working with them and there was huge – well, I say there was huge deceit. I don't know to this day what the mother knew and understood either." After the serious case review two social workers and a lawyer were given written warnings. No one was found guilty of gross misconduct and so there were no sackings, a decision by which she still stands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoesmith says it is a mistake to assume that the injuries that killed Baby P were a constant throughout the eight months. "They didn't have the evidence to take the child into care but they constantly were unhappy. You know, 'is there something here?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But we've got a helpful mother working with us, and then something colossal happens. There was a brutal attack on the child and if the public think that this child was being severely abused, when all of this time we're going in and out of this house and that's what they think, I would have walked immediately. I would have resigned on the 5th or 6th of August 2007, of course I would have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She didn't go the Old Bailey trial, but read the transcripts every night. She got the verdict by text and was instantly on a train into central London to brief the press. She had requested specialist training for this eventuality ("to me that was not unusual at all, and shouldn't be seen as such"), and a statement was prepared by the council, which she part-read along with the chief executive from Great Ormond Street hospital. "I obviously wasn't looking forward to it but I felt it was my responsibility to step up to that role, and to explain to the public, try to explain to the public what had happened. And it was a complete disaster, which I fully recognise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had hoped the press could read the serious case review, which didn't happen. The police had also pre-empted them by releasing an electronic picture of the damage done to Baby P, and briefed the press before the verdict, whereas the council had remained silent until after it, so feelings were already running high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement was rehearsed ‑&amp;nbsp; "perhaps we shouldn't have rehearsed it" – and as she read she could feel the tension in the room rising, of a "nature which I found hard to describe". Perhaps it was what she was saying. Was the word sorry in it at all? "No, and in a sense you sort of think, my goodness, it wasn't. You know, I've thought and thought about that and I thought, well in some ways we were so sorry and distressed about this, we almost did not say that. Nobody, you know nobody was more sorry and distressed than I was, to be sitting there telling this to the public through the press representatives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also regrets the moment when she was asked two questions at once, and turned to answer one when the other was "have you apologised to the father"? "And once I'd taken my attention away, this person – I don't know where they were from – said, 'Oh, that's a no then.'  And actually that was a grave mistake and that probably made people angry. I should have gone back and addressed it, and had I done, I would have said that we'd had good contact with the father. He'd been asked to contribute to the serious case review if he wished. He did decline. And we also clearly wrote to him and gave him our condolences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the press conference, "Haringey's team, who were with me, said you need to deal with this thing of, of sorry, and what I was saying back was, 'Well of course we're sorry' and I said right, OK, I need to say that better than I was doing." There were 15 interviews after the press conference, three of them live, and she says she said she was sorry, and deeply distressed, in every single one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the damage had been done. She was called cold and calculating, arrogant and smug. She says that "if anything, what I was doing was working hard not to break down, to deliver this message in a way that was not emotional ..." She knows that she simply "wasn't in touch with the mood of the public. When I had to answer the question as I'm asked it live – can you guarantee this won't happen again? – that's a really difficult question to answer but there is only one answer to it, you know. You have to say no. You can't stop people who are determined to kill their children. You can work as much as you can to prevent it, but that is the case." Scotland Yard, the Association of Directors of Children's Services, and the NSPCC all subsequently gave similar assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, 12 November, David Cameron called for sackings because there had been "a raft of excuses and not one apology … the buck has got to stop somewhere". The Liberal Democrat MP Lynne Featherstone, called for resignations and sackings, and a nationwide review of child protection procedures was ordered by the children's minister, Beverley Hughes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoesmith had already been asked, at the press conference, if she would resign, and she had said: "No. None of the agencies involved with the family are responsible for the death. Those responsible for this tragedy have been prosecuted." That might be true, according to the letter of the law, but did she not understand that there was an emotional, symbolic requirement as well, above and beyond the law, particularly in a borough that had been through this before?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Well, I would absolutely emphasise the sadness of the fact that there's a child dying every 10 days at the hands of their family or their extended family. Actually during the aftermath of Baby P that was shown to be more than that. Now if you are going to sack every director of every children's service where there is a child death, you're going to turn them over at the rate of a third a year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 13 the Sun demanded sackings, and vowed not to rest until it got them. If Shoesmith wouldn't go, it said, the government had to put in a new boss. "A price must be paid for his little life, and we will not rest until that price has been paid by those responsible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It ran pictures of Shoesmith and four others, with phone numbers underneath, urging readers acquainted with them to call in. Ed Balls, the children's secretary, ordered an independent review, and Haringey council made a formal apology.  Sixty-one headteachers wrote to the papers in support a couple of days later, but they were swept away by a campaign notable for the ugliness it permitted in some of its readers. The first time Shoesmith realised the size and nature of what was being unleashed against her was a call from her 89-year-old mother in Belfast, who had been told by a reporter that Shoesmith was responsible for the death of a child, and was immensely distressed. In order to avoid photographers outside her flat she had to leave for work at 6:30am and wait, at night, until neighbours told her the coast was clear. Both she and her youngest daughter received death threats, and her daughter had to be moved out of London. Her email inbox and voice messages filled with support but also with people calling her a child killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She began to suffer periods of uncontrollable shaking. One man called her at 5am every morning with a different suggestion for how to kill herself. Police advised her to stay away from tube platforms, because it would be so easy to push her off. She did, she admits, think of doing it herself anyway. "You do consider how to stop it all, you know. You can just walk off the end of the tube platform and stop it all and I certainly did think about that on occasion, and there was certainly another occasion in the middle of the night when I gathered up all the paracetamol that existed in the house and there was nothing like enough." Her daughters moved in to be with her day and night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one time she does cry is when she thinks of Maria Ward, the social worker, being the subject of a similar campaign, and becoming unable to operate; she was eventually moved away for her own safety. Even uninvolved Haringey social workers were reporting that they were finding it suddenly more difficult and frightening to do their jobs, because clients were refusing to co-operate, or being abusive. On 18 November the Sun quoted an anonymous Shoesmith family member saying they wanted her to go; she says this was completely untrue, but she knew it was a turning point. "Whatever that report said, there was only one route for me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 20 November, when questions were asked in parliament, Balls agreed that deception by the family played a great part, but that actions were also not taken that should have been taken. He saw no evidence of a conflict of interest in her chairing of the serious case review. When MPs demanded to know why Shoesmith was still in her post he answered: "I do not rule anything out, but people want action, and they want it in the fastest possible way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week later he reiterated the point in the Sun: he was waiting for the independent Ofsted report, to be published in three days' time (he had asked for it to take two weeks instead of the usual three months), and added: "I will not hesitate to act on what they say."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 26 November the Sun delivered a petition with 1.2m signatures to Downing Street, demanding that those involved be sacked. On Friday 28 November Shoesmith offered the council her resignation; they even agreed a form of words, that she was leaving by mutual consent, but the decision was quickly overtaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 6pm on Sunday night the independent report was delivered to Balls. It made devastating reading. It identified insufficient strategic leadership and management oversight; failure to ensure full compliance with post-Climbié recommendations; a lack of communication between social care, health and police authorities; a conflict of interest in the serious case review; failing to identify children at immediate risk of harm; inconsistent quality of frontline work; inconsistent and often poor record-keeping; too much reliance on quantitative v qualitative data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course I expected criticism," says Shoesmith. "Nothing is perfect. But not that. And I was really very shocked." Her objections are that the Ofsted inspectors' reference to a conflict of interest discredits her; no feedback was allowed, as is usually the case, with allegations put to the director, who can then try to defend herself. She says she had been led to believe it was an interim report, even though it clearly wasn't. It was also written in bald, unambiguous statements "quite unusual in a report because [usually in] the same paragraph you'd get some examples".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is struck by how there is almost nothing positive in it, even though she knows that in interviews some positive things were said. She also thinks it strange that two numbered paragraphs seem to be missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But was she making serious allegations against the writers of the report?  "Well, I don't know," she answers. "I don't think I'm putting an allegation to the writers of the report because they may not have written it that way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She only realised she had been replaced when Balls announced it on the news, on 1 December. A week later the council announced that she had been dismissed with immediate effect, without compensation, or payment in lieu of notice. Despite stories about million-pound pensions, she says she now has nothing – no savings, no income, and no pension. She is being supported by family and friends until she can get back on her feet. The Sun immediately claimed a triumph "for the biggest crusade of its kind in newspaper history". A few weeks later she would learn about her permanent successor from "a reporter shouting the news through my letterbox".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking about it since, she says she was "shocked at how fast it became a party political issue, both locally and nationally. I just think it's a huge travesty for Haringey and if there's anything I want to say it's that they deserve much better than this, because I know who the people are and how they've worked and how they've achieved, and it just has been deeply reckless, breathtakingly reckless, and I don't think people really understood quite what the potential impact could be. And now you've got this, a local tragedy and a national catastrophe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As after Climbié, there is anecdotal evidence of an increase in care proceedings, and Haringey, already struggling with recruitment, has had to appeal for social workers from other London boroughs "to try and cover Section 47 investigations, which are urgent investigations into potential abuse of children".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoesmith is deeply sceptical of Balls's recent statements about needing to rejuvenate social work as a respected profession. "Well, he's certainly made it a much more uphill struggle than it was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was he acting under pressure from the press? "I'm not going to answer your question directly," she says, "because I don't think I can, but I think what I would say to you is there are a number of people who need to quietly reflect on what it was they did in this whole story. And be open unto themselves as to how they behaved and why they behaved as they did, and to understand – not to blame them – but to understand, and to show greater courage the next time round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that's what I'd want to say."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/baby-p"&gt;Baby P&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/edballs"&gt;Ed Balls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/childprotection"&gt;Child protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/localgovernment"&gt;Local government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/childrensministry"&gt;Children's ministry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>The tax gap: creative accountants</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/feb/07/tax-avoidance-toms-ernst-and-young-accountants</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/88538?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Business%3A+Creative+accountants&amp;ch=Business&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Business&amp;c5=Business+Markets&amp;c6=Tax+gap+reporting+team&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1165173&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Business&amp;c12=&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FBusiness%2F" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 18 February 2002, Ernst &amp; Young mounted a confidential slideshow for Nikki Maynard and her tax team at Prudential, the big insurance company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a sales pitch. The accountants explained their latest avoidance wheeze,  which they hoped Prudential would buy for a large sum of money. But they warned that the chance was a "one-off" only, because the chancellor intended to block off the accidental gap in the rules after 1 October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E&amp;Y did not use so indelicate a word as "loophole" and certainly not the term "ruse". It called the situation an "asymmetry" and described its pitch in correspondence as the "opportunity".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Prudential acted quickly enough, their tax team gathered, the "opportunity" could make millions. The Pru was one of the lucky companies that had outstanding foreign loans. These made the "tax-enhanced" manoeuvre possible. For its fee, E&amp;Y wanted &amp;pound;200,000 cash upfront. If the scheme actually succeeded, it was then to be paid another &amp;pound;300,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prudential signed up. Accountants  rapidly sold the same scheme to a total of 30 firms, so they were looking at making &amp;pound;15m out of their ingenious "opportunity". The government, however, as an alarmed Revenue later calculated, faced losing a total of &amp;pound;1bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project Toms, so-called, was one of the most notable of the avoidance schemes peddled by the "big four" international accountancy firms - Ernst &amp; Young, PwC, Deloitte, and KPMG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ernst &amp; Young acquired a reputation for maximum aggression. But the transcript of a tribunal hearing in 2007, from which these details are taken, provides a rare insight into the international methods used, according to Revenue sources, by all of the big four at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The engine driving the industry is now a horde of tax advisers cooking up one complex scheme after another," says US senator Carl Levin, who has campaigned against the  tax avoiders in America with the past support of the incoming president, Barack Obama. Levin warns: "The tax shelter industry is ... fundamentally different than it was a few years ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toms was so destructive that the British government was driven to attempt a clampdown by ordering disclosure in advance of all future such schemes. Toms stood for "tax-efficient off-market swaps". The scheme revolved around what are known as currency swaps, a method of insuring against foreign exchange fluctuations. A company contracts to get a set sum in a particular currency, at a future date, which it pays for in another currency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E&amp;Y's idea was a method of claiming a tax loss on the payment out, while not being liable for tax when the payment came back in in another currency. It involved setting an unrealistic currency exchange rate, but charging an inflated arrangement fee called a "front-end payment".  A tribunal subsequently found this was a "deliberate mislabelling".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the schemes to work, it was also necessary to have the co-operation of  a bank. Prudential sought to operate the scheme twice, hoping to stack up more than &amp;pound;100m of artificial losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time, the Pru went to Royal Bank of Scotland. But RBS refused to do it a second time. The bank's internal emails revealed  that it was too worried about its reputation. According to the judgment, however, Goldman Sachs International was prepared to oblige, for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prudential said that as the case, which is under appeal, was still live "it would be inappropriate for us to comment".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ernst &amp; Young told us: "All of the tax work we advise on is legal and properly disclosed. It is part of our fundamental duty to our clients to counsel them on the most appropriate tax planning options allowed within the current tax legislation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Bad weather spreads across UK</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/feb/07/weather-transport</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/41582?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=UK+news%3A+Blizzards%2C+blocked+bridges+and+a+baby+born+in+a+car+as+bad+weather+spreads&amp;ch=UK+news&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Weather+UK+%28News%29%2CWeather+%28Forecasts%29%2CTransport+UK%2CUK+news&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Steven+Morris%2CSeverin+Carrell&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1165147&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=UK+news&amp;c12=Weather&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FUK+news%2FWeather" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two Severn bridge crossings between England and Wales were among hundreds of roads and routes closed while snow continued to create chaos across regions of Britain yesterday, with more than 20,000 homes left without electricity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of hundreds of motorists trapped by a blizzard in Devon on Thursday night and yesterday morning were only last night able to get home in the freezing conditions. The government said it was doing all it could to ensure councils had the gritting salt they needed, and said it was considering importing supplies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 250 calls a minute were being made to the AA by stranded motorists, the rescue organisation said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as 4,000 schools were shut and regional airports in England and Wales struggled to keep runways clear. Police and councils warned people against trying to travel, unless it was absolutely necessary. In Luton, the local authority urged people not to come into the town centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Met Office had reports of up to 50cm (20in) of snow on Dartmoor and Exmoor in Devon. Today is due to be bright, clear and cold in many parts of the UK - but more snow could here tomorrow and Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tales of heroism and community spirit emerged following rapid and heavy snowfalls in Devon on Thursday night. Councillors, shopkeepers and emergency services made sure up to 500 stranded motorists at Haldon Hill, near Exeter, and elsewhere, were looked after. Reception centres were set up in Chudleigh and Okehampton on the edge of Dartmoor. Scores spent an uncomfortable night at Exeter services. By yesterday afternoon police began to reopen roads and asked motorists to return to abandoned vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further west, one couple was rescued after seven hours trapped in their car when it skidded into a ditch on a remote lane near Camelford, north Cornwall. A navy helicopter was unable to locate the couple but finally a local farmer found them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Okehampton, an RAF helicopter was unable to get through when Andrea Dunn went into labour. Instead, she was driven through the snow in a fire engine on a seven-mile journey which took 40 minutes because firefighters twice had to clear away fallen trees. She arrived at hospital in time to give birth to twin girls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Northamptonshire Kelly Roberts, 29, gave birth to a girl while stuck in traffic, to the delight of cheering lorry drivers. In Scotland a team of doctors was airlifted onto a leisure centre's playing field to treat a premature baby fallen ill on Shetland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Severn bridges between England and Wales were closed after huge sheets of ice fell from overhead road signs; the windscreens of five cars were smashed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closings caused tailbacks and hit attempts by engineers of Western Power to restore power to 21,000 homes. Homes in Devon Cornwall, Gloucestershire and Somerset were hit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state of the roads drew continued criticism. Transport minister Lord Adonis told BBC radio the government was making sure gritting salt was fairly distributed: "We're working to see local authorities which face an acute situation are prioritised for new supplies." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A container ship from Spain with 40,000 tonnes of salt and a ship from Germany carrying further supplies were due to dock on Wednesday, the Local Government Association said. Gloucestershire is low on rock salt but has instead found 500 tonnes of white table salt; the council said it would resort to any means necessary in the extreme conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of Welsh rugby fans hoping to get to Scotland for Sunday's Six Nations match had their flights cancelled or delayed yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, around a million children were enjoying an early start to the weekend. At Nova Hreod school in Swindon, 50 year 10 and 11 pupils were suspended when they refused to come in from the playing field after a morning break. In contrast, a group of pupils at Kingham Hill school in Oxfordshire built an igloo village on their field and camped out for the night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One bride had to contend with the snow for her very white wedding. Natalie Britton, 33, was an hour and 15 minutes late for her marriage to Philip Cass, 36, in south Gloucestershire after her hairdresser and flower arrangers got stuck in the snow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there were instances of bravery and heroism, there were also examples of stupidity. Emergency services criticised "mindless idiots" who built snow walls across roads in Lincolnshire. And an internet site showed video of a daredevil snowboarder towed through Hungerford, in Berkshire, by a car. Police said they would prosecute the driver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also curiosities. Fears that big cats are prowling Britain resurfaced after large paw prints were found in the snow in Lincolnshire. And in Cornwall a swallow nicknamed Rambo is surviving the cold by living on insects found on seaweed beside the sea wall at Marazion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/weather"&gt;Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/transport"&gt;Transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Senate reaches tentative deal on stimulus plan</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/07/barack-obama-stimulus-plan-deal</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/60186?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=World+news%3A+Senate+reaches+tentative+deal+on+Obama%27s+stimulus+plan&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=guardian.co.uk&amp;c4=Obama+administration%2CUS+economy+%28Business%29%2CUS+Congress%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news%2CUS+domestic+policy&amp;c5=Unclassified%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CUS+Elections%2CUS+Economy&amp;c6=Associated+Press&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1165224&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=World+news&amp;c12=Obama+administration&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FWorld+news%2FObama+administration" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid stunning new job losses and the latest bank failure, key senators and the White House reached tentative agreement last night on an economic stimulus measure at the heart of Barack Obama's recovery plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two officials said the emerging agreement was for a bill with a $780bn (£527bn) price tag, but there was no immediate confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tentative agreement capped a tense day of back-room negotiations in which Senate majority leader Harry Reid, joined by White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, sought to attract the support of enough Republicans to give the measure the needed 60-vote majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials strongly suggested that senator Edward M Kennedy's vote would be needed to assure passage. The Massachusetts Democrat, battling a brain tumour, has been in Florida in recent days and has not been in the Washington DC since suffering a seizure on inauguration day more than two weeks ago. The senator's office did not comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Senate rules, a senator must be in the chamber to vote. Reid met privately in the Capitol with members of his rank and file to present the proposed deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At $780bn, the legislation would be smaller than the measure that cleared the House of Representatives on a party-line vote last week. It also would mean a sharp cut from the bill that has been the subject of Senate debate for a week. That measure stood at $937bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the numbers, though, any agreement would mark a victory for the new president and would keep Democratic leaders on track to fulfil their promise of delivering him a bill to sign by the end of next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/obama-administration"&gt;Obama administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/useconomy"&gt;US economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress"&gt;US Congress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usdomesticpolicy"&gt;US domestic policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

Poor man, he's actually seen the books. We have this one-eyed Scottish idiot who keeps telling us everything's fine and he's saved the world and we know he's lying, but he's smooth at telling us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarkson, whose Sunday Times columns are syndicated in the Weekend Australian, was referring to Brown, who lost his sight in one eye during after an accident playing rugby as a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scottish politicians have urged the BBC to take Clarkson off air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Foulkes, a former Labour Scottish minister, said he was "outraged" at the presenter's remarks. Foulkes said: "If the BBC banned Jonathan Ross for what he said and they have taken Carol Thatcher off air for something she said in private, then something should be done about Clarkson."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He has insulted Gordon Brown three times over – accusing him of being a liar, having a go at him for having a physical handicap and for his nationality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is an absolute outrage of the worst kind. Disabled people will be up in arms about it, Scottish people will be angry – and it should concern all of us that the prime minister has been accused of lying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarkson's description of Brown was branded "offensive" and "totally unacceptable" by a charity for the blind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesley-Anne Alexander, the chief executive for the Royal National Institute of Blind People, said: "Clarkson's description of the prime minister is offensive. Any suggestion that equates disability with incompetence is totally unacceptable. We would be happy to help Clarkson understand the positive contribution people with sight loss make to society."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angus Robertson, the SNP leader at Westminster, joined the chorus of disapprobal, saying the comments were "totally inappropriate".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone should be upset about someone making jokes about someone else's partial blindness and nationality, but knowing Jeremy Clarkson I don't hold out a lot of hope that he will be apologetic," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Clarkson's apology, a Downing Street spokesman declined to respond to Clarkson's description, saying: "I don't think I'm going to get into those comments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked at a daily briefing of Westminster reporters how Brown would respond to the suggestion that Rudd was being more honest with voters about the economic crisis, the spokesman said: "Clarkson is entitled to his own interpretation of the economic circumstances."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time the presenter has courted controversy. In November last year &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mediamonkeyblog/2008/nov/04/jeremyclarkson-bbc" title=""&gt;he opened the latest series of Top Gear by suggesting that truck drivers only cared about fuel prices and murdering prostitutes&lt;/a&gt;, drawing hundreds of complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarkson and his Top Gear co-hosts were also condemned by their own employers in July for &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jul/03/bbc.television" title=""&gt;"glamorising the misuse of alcohol"&lt;/a&gt; by drinking at the wheel last July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC Trust's editorial complaints unit said a special edition of the motoring show, aired the previous July, in which Clarkson and co-host James May attempted to drive a pickup truck to the magnetic north pole, broke its guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the programme, Clarkson and May were shown drinking gin and tonics as they raced Richard Hammond, who was using a sled pulled by a team of dogs, to reach the pole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarkson's latest indiscretion follows hot on the heels of the storm surrounding BBC One Show presenter Carol Thatcher being thrown off the programme for referring to male tennis player as a "golliwog" while off-air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BBC has received more than 2,200 complaints over its &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/feb/05/complaints-to-bbc-for-dropping-carol-thatcher" title=""&gt;decision to drop the former prime minister's daughter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;•&amp;nbsp;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

      <title>US dismay as 'father' of Pakistan A-bomb freed</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/07/pakistan-nuclear</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/47279?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=World+news%3A+US+dismay+as+%27father%27+of+Pakistan+A-bomb+freed&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Pakistan+%28News%29%2CNuclear+issues+%28not+energy%29%2CArms+trade+%28News%29%2CWorld+news&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Saeed+Shah%2CAidan+Jones&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1165151&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=World+news&amp;c12=Pakistan&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FWorld+news%2FPakistan" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US and Britain have reacted angrily after AQ Khan, the Pakistani scientist accused of selling nuclear secrets, was freed from five years of house arrest in a court ruling in Islamabad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khan, lionised as the "father" of Pakistan's nuclear bomb, confessed in 2004 to selling nuclear secrets to Iran, North Korea and Libya. He was immediately pardoned by Pakistan but confined to his home under heavy guard. His freedom appears to have been won through a secret deal with the government, which was sanctified by the court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the Guardian after yesterday's judgement, the metallurgist said he had no plans to travel abroad or take part in politics. Looking relaxed and well, the 72-year-old strolled in the front garden of his villa in Islamabad, which he shares with his Dutch wife and grand-daughter, playing with a pet dog and receiving wellwishers. "It's a nice feeling, the worry is gone. I can lead a normal life now as a normal citizen. It's a fine feeling," he later said by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The celebrations did not extend to Washington and London, which have long sought to question Khan. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, said she was "very much concerned" about Khan's release. Gordon Duguid, a state department spokesman, said the US believed Khan "remains a serious proliferation risk".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Gibbs, a White House spokesman, said Barack Obama wanted "assurances" from Pakistan the scientist would not be involved in nuclear proliferation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said last night: "We continue to call on the Pakistani government to allow the [International Atomic Energy Agency] access to Mr Khan in order to seek information about his nuclear proliferation activities, in particular his supplying of secrets to Iran and North Korea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khan's release could affect the aid that Pakistan receives from the US, a leading member of Congress warned, with a $15bn (&amp;pound;10bn) proposed assistance package currently before lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howard Berman, who chairs the House foreign affairs committee, said: "The Pakistani government may in effect be giving him license to resume, perhaps directly, his past actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Congress will take this into account as we review and create legislation on US-Pakistan relations and the circumstances under which US assistance is provided to Islamabad," said Berman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khan's nuclear trading network, which extended to 12 countries including Iran, Libya and North Korea, was uncovered by western intelligence agents in late 2003, putting pressure on Pakistan, which then sacked him as head of its weapons programme and put him under house arrest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A national hero in Pakistan for spearheading the country's nuclear weapons programme, he subsequently retracted the confession. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khan's lawyer, Ali Zafar, said that he had been freed under the terms of a "mutual agreement" between the scientist and the government, but details were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is thought that the deal means he agreed to continue have state-provided security - he has been guarded by intelligence agents and army personnel since his detention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nuclear-issues"&gt;Nuclear issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arms-trade"&gt;Arms trade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Guinness to label pint glasses with unit count</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/feb/07/guinness-units-alcohol</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/37857?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Society%3A+Guinness+to+label+pint+glasses+with+unit+count&amp;ch=Society&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Drugs+and+alcohol+%28Society%29%2CFood+and+drink+industry+%28Business%29%2CBusiness%2CSociety%2CUK+news&amp;c5=Society+Weekly%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CBusiness+Markets%2CCommunities+Society&amp;c6=James+Meikle&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1165152&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Society&amp;c12=Drugs+and+alcohol&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FSociety%2FDrugs+and+alcohol" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guinness drinkers will soon have little excuse for not knowing how many units of alcohol is in their favourite pint. The maker of the Irish stout is supplying bars with 500,000 branded glasses carrying a unit count - 2.3 a pint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move, an industry first for draught beer, will cover only a tiny fraction of the 9.4bn pints a year served in pubs, but comes as ministers consider making compulsory a voluntary agreement drawn up more than 10 years ago about the labelling of alcoholic content on bottles and cans, as well as introducing new legal requirements on sales and promotions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Roscoe, marketing director for Guinness UK, part of the Diageo drinks group, said the unit count would help drinkers "get a better grasp on the amount of alcohol they are consuming". He recognised "not all alcohol is served in bespoke glasses ... but if the glasses are effective it would be good to see units on glassware becoming more widespread". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checks for the government last year found that only 57% of the drinks industry gave information on units and only 3% had acted on further promises made in 2007 to add government guidelines for "lower risk" drinking and its warning against drinking while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Official advice recommends men should not regularly drink more than 3-4 units of alcohol a day, women 2-3 units. New measures could include compulsory listing of alcohol units on drinks menus and offering wider choices of glass size. Compulsory unit labelling on unbranded glasses would probably not be practical given the wide variety of drinks and their alcoholic strength. But 95% of all beer sales in pubs are from the pump, so drinks menus with alcohol unit counts would still mark a significant increase in the information required in licensed premises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 350m pints of Guinness a year are drunk in Britain, and Mark Hastings, of the British Beer and Pub Association, said there was a big growth in the use of branded glasses. But it was only one example of ways in which companies were trying to help drinkers make an informed choice. There was "almost universal" unit information on beer cans and bottles, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beer pumps already carried details of a drink's alcohol by volume . "It is information and it is useful," even if it did not link directly to a unit message. "I think people can tell what is a weak beer and a strong beer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hastings added that there was a debate about whether people wanted information when they were purchasing a drink or would prefer making choices after studying information, for instance, on the industry-backed Drinkaware website. This invites consumers to use its unit calculator, multiplying alcohol by volume in a particular drink by the number of millilitres and dividing by 1000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Portman Group - an organisation of companies trying to encourage responsible drinking - said putting information on glasses was "a very good way of educating consumers". The charity Alcohol Concern said: "It is a fantastic idea." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health was reluctant yesterday to give its view on glass labelling, saying it did not yet know what might be in any mandatory code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol units&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stella Artois&lt;/strong&gt; 5.2% 1pt &lt;strong&gt; 2.95&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boddingtons&lt;/strong&gt; 4.1% 1pt&lt;strong&gt;  2.33 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lanson Black Label champagne 12.5% &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large glass (250ml)&lt;strong&gt; 3.13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standard glass (175ml)&lt;strong&gt; 2.19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wolf Blass chardonnay 13.5% &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large glass&lt;strong&gt; 3.38&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standard glass&lt;strong&gt; 2.36&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typical red wine 13%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large glass&lt;strong&gt; 3.25&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standard glass&lt;strong&gt; 2.28&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/drugs-and-alcohol"&gt;Drugs and alcohol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/fooddrinks"&gt;Food &amp; drink industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Contaminated medicine kills 84 children</title>

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/23229?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=World+news%3A+Contaminated+medicine+kills+84+children&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Nigeria+%28News%29%2CWorld+news&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Sarah+Boseley&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1165157&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=World+news&amp;c12=Nigeria&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FWorld+news%2FNigeria" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 84 children have died in Nigeria after being given a teething mixture contaminated with the chemical diethylene glycol, which is normally used in brake fluid as an antifreeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Pikin Baby Teething Mixture was launched in early November, purportedly as a paracetamol syrup to treat teething pains. But the product was contaminated with the chemical, causing liver and kidney failure in the babies and children given it, the country's health ministry said. About 111 children aged between two months and seven years became ill and 75% died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nigerian manufacturer has been closed down by the country's food and drugs agency, Nafdac, which has ordered all drug distribution outlets to hand over stocks. Dora Akunyili, Nafdac's director general, described the situation as a public health emergency and called on all health organisations to cooperate to help remove the teething mixture from circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The death of any Nigerian child is a great loss to the nation," said Babatunde Oshotimehin, the country's health minister. "The federal ministry of health sincerely regrets this painful incident and sympathises with the nation and the families directly affected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nafdac said staff of the mixture's Lagos-based manufacturer, Barewa Pharmaceuticals, bought ingredients from an unregistered chemical dealer in a slum near the city's main tip. Officials say Barewa Pharmaceuticals appears to have been told it was buying propylene glycol, a normal ingredient in teething formula. It is not known how many of the contaminated bottles were manufactured or sold. Several people, including staff from Barewa, are under arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/audio/2009/feb/06/guardian-daily-podcast</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The foreign secretary, &lt;strong&gt;David Miliband&lt;/strong&gt;, has defended his decision to keep secret evidence of the alleged torture of Binyam Mohamed, a British resident of Guantánamo Bay. He told the Commons there was no threat from the US, but that the Americans would review their sharing of intelligence with Britain if information was made public. Is Miliband telling the truth? Is he being consistent? I ask the Guardian's security editor, &lt;strong&gt;Richard Norton-Taylor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head of business &lt;strong&gt;Dan Roberts&lt;/strong&gt; explains the Bank of England's decision to cut interest rates by half a percentage point to 1% yesterday. And he looks at the unexpected news from the Halifax that house prices increased in January by 1.9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A House of Lords committee publishes a report today on Britain's use of surveillance. Home affairs editor &lt;strong&gt;Alan Travis&lt;/strong&gt; says it challenges many of the assumptions by supporters of surveillance, and warns of a grave danger to our right to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zambian economist &lt;strong&gt;Dambisa Moyo&lt;/strong&gt; tells &lt;strong&gt;Mark Tran&lt;/strong&gt; why the credit crisis might work in Africa's favour, if it eases the developing world's dependence on western aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And arts correspondent &lt;strong&gt;Mark Brown&lt;/strong&gt; considers the work of James Patterson, named today as the most borrowed author from Britain's public libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Wales seek an end to boom and bust</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/feb/07/six-nations-wales-rugby-union</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/50638?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Sport%3A+Wales+seek+an+end+to+boom+and+bust&amp;ch=Sport&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Six+Nations+rugby%2CWales+rugby+union+team%2CRugby+union%2CSport&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CRugby+Union&amp;c6=Richard+Williams&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1165102&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Sport&amp;c12=Six+Nations+rugby&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FSport%2FSix+Nations+rugby" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The voices of history warn us to be sceptical when Wales march into the Six Nations Championship wearing the badge of undisputed favourites, as they do this weekend. Travelling to Scotland for tomorrow's demanding opener at Murrayfield, a place where odds are often upset, they find themselves quoted at 2–1 to retain the title they won last March, at the end of a campaign that had brought them their 10th grand slam. But the men in red need only cast their eyes back three years to a time when, setting off from an identical position, they crumbled so badly that within weeks the whole of Welsh rugby seemed to have collapsed with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As had become a habit since the ­glorious 1970s, triumph went to Welsh heads. "We might have had a bit of a hangover," Robin McBryde, the hooker in the 2005 side and now coaching the current squad's pack, said this week. "We hadn't had that level of success for a number of years and ­perhaps we were a bit guilty of standing still and not making sure we kept moving our game forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were guilty of more than that. The fall of Mike Ruddock, the man of Gwent who guided them to the 2005 triumph, exposed a viper's nest of mistrust and disloyalty. Player power, in the hands of a group of senior internationals who retained strong links to the previous regime, undermined and finally did for a head coach who had appeared to blend the stern imperatives of the modern professional game with the precious Welsh ­tradition of inventive heads-up rugby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years later, most of those ­senior players will be back on the pitch to face Scotland. The mood, however, is very ­different in a squad now entering their second season under the leadership of Warren Gatland, their Kiwi head coach, and his principal assistants, the ­Englishman Shaun Edwards and the former Wales scrum-half Rob Howley. The presence of a triumvirate forged ­during successful seasons at Wasps ensures, as McBryde says, that "rugby decisions are being made by rugby people". Facing the ­familiar charge that the only thing worse for Wales than failure is success, they are now mounting an insistent campaign against complacency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only thing I can do is talk about it," Gatland said before departing for Edinburgh. "We've spoken about the egos ­getting too big for them, about the preparation not being as good, about not challenging each other. And none of those things has happened. I haven't seen their egos getting too big. I've seen them work even harder this year than they did 12 months ago. We had a training session on Saturday that was as tough as anything they've done. Twelve months ago they wouldn't have been able to get through it. But they got through it comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no secret to it. The key is to get them to challenge themselves, to be hard on themselves. It's not the external pressure that's the problem – it's the pressure you put on yourself in terms of wanting to perform. The coaches can drive a certain amount but it's got to come from within the squad. The leaders in the team have got to demand that quality – be tough on each other at training. They've responded very well to it and there have been no signs to me that we aren't going to go into this tournament prepared."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, according to Martyn Williams, the back-row forward who is due to earn his 85th cap for Wales today, there was a feeling of "Right, we've done it" among the ­players. "And after the last grand slam and the Lions tour, a quarter of the side were out injured with long-term serious injuries," he said. "Now everyone's fit and we've got strength in depth. That's a big difference. We had nowhere near this depth two years ago, and when we did have a few players out we struggled. This time we're being constantly reminded that we've got to kick on. We want to be a great side, not just a good side."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While defeats in November at the hands of South Africa and New Zealand reminded the players of how much work remains to be done, the subsequent victory over Australia made them the only Six Nations side to beat a southern-hemisphere team during the autumn. "It reminded us of how well we can play," Shane Williams, the International Rugby Board's world player of the year, said on Wednesday. "We were disappointed in the way we played in the first half against South Africa and in the second half against New Zealand. In the Australia game we got everything right. It reminded us that when we can play consistently well for 80 minutes, we can win a game like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added impetus comes from the recent success of two regional teams, the Ospreys and the Blues, in reaching the Heineken Cup quarter-finals. The two sides contribute more than half of Gatland's squad. "The beauty of it is that they've come in as winners," said Alan Phillips, now in his ­seventh year as Wales's team manager. "They're pumped-up already. In the early years of professionalism, our sides weren't strong enough. Now they are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decisive moment in the recent  history of Welsh rugby appears to have been the defeat by Fiji during the 2007 Rugby World Cup one autumn day in Nantes. Roger Lewis, the Welsh Rugby Union's new chief executive, resolved to "clean the stables" by creating a culture of honesty and integrity. The appointment of Gatland, universally admired for his achievements with Waikato, Ireland and Wasps, was the first step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fewer headlines were attracted by the appointment of new directors of finance, legal affairs and communications to an organisation still preoccupied with ­reducing the debt incurred by the building of Cardiff's Millennium Stadium (down by £10m last year, to £30m). But the 54-year‑old Lewis, a music graduate who ran Radio One, EMI Records and Classic FM before returning to Wales, sees the ­playing and administrative sides as ­requiring the same qualities and approach in a drive to end the proverbial volatility of Welsh rugby through a strategy of "long-term sustainability, on and off the field".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results could be seen this week in the presence of bulldozers at the Vale of Glamorgan hotel, a resort complex a ­couple of miles off the M4, where the Wales squad's headquarters are being revamped through a large investment in an indoor centre containing sophisticated match-analysis equipment, flanked by a new indoor pitch and three outdoor &lt;sup&gt;­&lt;/sup&gt;playing surfaces: one all-weather, one regular, and one prepared to international standards. A new centre of excellence will be opened later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have talent in Wales," Lewis said, "and we also have a culture that can be incredibly tough on itself. In our rugby, we've had very clear values and beliefs. They were eroded in the 80s and 90s, and to some extent in the present decade. But it's in adversity that an organisation is challenged, and we've managed to find the people to address the issues that were facing us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success on the field, he admitted, has come earlier than expected in what began its life as a five-year plan to secure a place among the world's top five international sides. "We haven't arrived yet. Neither the business nor the rugby team is the ­finished article. It's a five-year project just to get our roots bedded in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The awareness of the need for ­realism in the fight against complacency has been evident all week. "Let's be honest with ourselves," Gatland said. "We performed pretty well in the autumn and we're ­trying to play some positive rugby but you can't say we're overwhelming favourites." His captain, Ryan Jones, was asked about the pressure of being ­favourites and responded: "We're just contenders." Lewis, the man in charge of a £25m annual investment in all levels of Welsh rugby, pointed out: "We need systems and structures that are robust enough to weather the storm of defeat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impeccable sentiments, and only when the players cross the whitewash at pitiless Murrayfield will it be clear whether a centennial repetition of the back-to-back grand slams of 1908 and 1909 is on the cards, or whether the ghosts of the past are preparing, once again, to consign the last year's applause to the file marked ­Premature Euphoria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/sixnations"&gt;Six Nations rugby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/wales-rugby-union-team"&gt;Wales rugby union team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/rugby-union"&gt;Rugby union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Zola gives West Ham a new style</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/feb/07/gianfranco-zola-west-ham-united</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/80624?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Football%3A+Zola+confounds+sceptics+to+give+West+Ham+a+new+style+in+straitened+times&amp;ch=Football&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=West+Ham+United+%28Football%29%2CPremier+League+%28Football%29%2CFootball%2CSport&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CPremier+League&amp;c6=Paul+Doyle&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1165095&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Football&amp;c12=West+Ham+United&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FFootball%2FWest+Ham+United" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;When Gianfranco Zola became West Ham United's first foreign manager in mid-­September, the club sat seventh in the league, having won twice at home and lost twice away. Now they are eighth, and have still lost as many league matches as they have won. Talk of a transformation, then, is over the top. Yet significant change is clearly under way at Upton Park. Where once there were forebodings of doom, now there is optimism, as reflected in a belief that the club can extend their eight‑game unbeaten streak when Manchester United come calling tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are playing good football at the moment and the players are determined to continue," Zola says. "We will certainly try to win because I never play to draw. Even away to Arsenal last week we went to win and we only ended up defending so much because Arsenal forced us backwards." West Ham's resilience in emerging with a 0-0 draw at the Emirates came as no surprise to Arsène Wenger, who had already hailed Zola's team as "probably the best in the Premier League right now".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubts persist about the club's long-term financial sustainability if their owner fails to find the buyer he seeks, but the anticipated mass exodus of players ­during the January transfer window did not happen. Whereas Zola's predecessor, Alan Curbishley, quit at the start of the season in protest at players being sold against his wishes, the Italian's only regrettable loss was Craig Bellamy, and he consoled himself with the loan capture of Czech international Radoslav Kovac, securing the excellent Herita Ilunga to a permanent contract, and the club-record purchase of Savio Nsereko. If that unexpected extravagance hints that the chalice he inherited may not have contained as much poison as originally feared, it is also true that Zola himself has come up with an antidote to many of the team's ills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One clear change he has made is ­psychological, with the striker Carlton Cole being the most obvious beneficiary of his infectious bonhomie. For so long a frustrating player because a lackadaisical approach seemed to undermine his undoubted potential, Cole has struck six goals in his past seven games and improved to the extent that some are tipping him for an England call-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's about attitude," Zola says. "You just have to keep telling him he can do it. It was not that he lacked aggression before, more that he was never truly convinced that he could always be a problem for top opponents but the fact is he can be as good as he wants to be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pep-talks can only achieve so much. Zola has also presided over a tactical turnaround. At first he tinkered heavily with the team, causing many to wonder whether his lack of managerial experience meant he was unsuited to guiding the club through turbulent times. However, once he settled on his preferred line-up, results improved and, what is more, the slick play with which he has always been synonymous followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zola's commitment to cerebral, on-the-deck football has clearly found favour with his players. Formation diagrams usually assign Jack Collison and Valon Behrami, for instance, to unfamiliar wide roles, but in reality they tend to dart all over midfield, sometimes augmenting the dynamic Scott Parker and Mark Noble in the centre, sometimes switching flanks entirely. The manager gives them licence to indulge their talent and instincts without diluting the emphasis on solidity. With David Di&amp;nbsp;Michele flitting around Cole in a free role, West Ham's movement often ­confounds opponents, while their work ethic means they rarely leave gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't really compare with what has gone on here before, but I think we're now training more with the ball," Zola says. "We have it for at least 80% of our sessions and I think the players enjoy that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integral to that training is the former ­Chelsea assistant manager Steve Clarke, whom Zola insisted on hiring as his No2. Just as West Ham's results have improved since Clarke's arrival, Chelsea's have ­deteriorated since he left Stamford Bridge and Zola is happy to give credit to the Scot. "I've always considered him one of the most important parts in what I'm doing," Zola says. "That's why I said I was only going to take the job if I had somebody like Steve by my side."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their differing playing careers meant the assumption has been that Clarke takes charge of the defence while Zola looks after the attacking side of things, but the manager claims that the opposite is true. "The defenders and attackers all train together because it is all about cooperation," Zola says. "Only one day a week do we separate them and – you won't believe me now – but on that day I take the defence and Steve works with the attackers." Decidedly, the little Italian keeps on showing that there is more to them than meets the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/westhamunited"&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/80562?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Books%3A+Incidents+along+the+road&amp;ch=Books&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=WG+Sebald+%28Author%29%2CWill+Self+%28Author%29%2CFiction+%28Books+genre%29%2CBooks%2CCulture+section&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Will+Self&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1164673&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Books&amp;c12=WG+Sebald&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FBooks%2FWG+Sebald" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading WG Sebald I felt a growing affinity, although not with the man himself - I never met, let alone knew him - nor with humanity in general. Indeed, immersed in Sebald, the inversion of Schopenhauer's dictum "The more I love mankind, the less I love men" often occurs to me: the more his fictional alter ego reverences individual men and women, the less he seems to love mankind. I couldn't say exactly what my Sebaldian progression has been: there was reading and then rereading, so that passages from one text interpolated, Russian-doll-like, into another, much as his raconteur characters find their voice in the accents of Sebald's style. I suspect The Rings of Saturn came first, followed by The Emigrants, followed by Austerlitz. Then I tackled the lectures Sebald gave in Zurich in 1997, published under the title On the Natural History of Destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Vertigo, until a few weeks ago I had both confused and conflated this with After Nature, and while I had nibbled at the latter, I managed only a morsel. Speaking of Sebald with his (and now my) editor Bill Swainson, I learned of the existence of this other novel - one that Swainson felt would help me with my as yet inchoate theory concerning Sebald's methodology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, with such sporadic immersion, you can appreciate that mine is not an academic critical approach, yet nor is it an exercise in overweening fandom, such as that enacted by Nicholson Baker to John Updike in his - very funny - book U &amp; I. Unlike Baker, I did not require Sebald's affirmation, or even acknowledgment. With most dead writers such intercourse would be an impossibility, but the intensity of Sebald's authorial voice, and the conviction expressed in his work again and again that the barrier between the living and the dead is semi-permeable, might have led a writer more credulous than I to tap upon Ouija keys rather than qwertyuiop ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suppose I could have chased up past interviews with Sebald. However, as a writer, I'm not convinced that we are the best equipped to understand how we go about the business of literary production. If, as Flannery O'Connor asserted, to be a writer of fiction requires a certain "calculated stupidity", then part of that, surely, is a willed ignorance of the mechanical side of production: the symbolic cogs of the imagination and traumatic winding gear of the unconscious. The novelist, quite rightly, fears the psychoanalyst as both an enemy and a usurper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In truth, even if they have an imperfect insight into their own methods, I still slightly mistrust writers of fiction who are assured literary critics; it makes me suspect that they favour the word over the world it should describe. Such scribes fall victim too easily to the solecism of equating style with morality. Go a little further along that road and you end up on the verge, eating shoots and leaves, and ruminating on the ethics of orthography. Nabokov, who skips with his butterfly net through the pages of Sebald's The Emigrants, is perhaps the exception that proves this rule, and maybe that's why he coined the observation - confusing to critics, but not to writers - that "you can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Sebald, on the evidence of his Zurich lectures, was not that great a critic: opinionated, axe-grinding, leaden of metrical foot. This may seem unjust, given that his aim was not to enthuse, or even explicate, but - far more importantly - to bear witness to the moral, and stylistic, bankruptcy of a writer such as Alfred Andersch, who was tainted by the Nazi regime, and the corresponding heroism of Jean Am&amp;eacute;ry, who was tortured by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others may thrust me in the direction of Sebald's academic papers. However, dealing, as I imagine they do, with the literature he himself regarded as prelapsarian (works of the early 20th and the 19th centuries), and therefore not compelling readers to a consideration of the zeitgeist, they might only underscore the tendency - demonstrated by his fictive alter ego - towards lofty-mindedness that in a lesser writer would be experienced as Talleyrand's douceur de la vie - that sickly conviction that everything was better in the old days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, no great critic - and maybe with a hint of snobbery as well. There's worse, too, for while Adorno may have ascribed to Beckett's work a "joyful pessimism", in Sebald's we find, emanating in palpable waves from their nebulous narrator, a kind of fey melancholia: this is a sensibility that revels in its solipsism, finding there an ineffable sweetness. Some critics of The Rings of Saturn, for example, were taken by the improbability of anyone walking - as Sebald's alter ego does - for the 25-odd coastal miles from Lowestoft to Middleton in Suffolk, without meeting a considerable number of people. But you have only to read his other books (I hesitate to call them "novels") to discover landscape after cityscape devoid of population. Sebald's narrator is always walking in empty streets, sitting in empty railway carriages, or eating in restaurants purged of their clientele. Admittedly, he often finds this "curious", as he does much he encounters along the way, but when he does come upon people they are too often "dwarfish", subsumed to their mode of transport, or scattered about - as are the backpackers outside Venice station in Vertigo - like corpses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be argued that just as Sebald's self-imposed exile from Bavaria became the emotional lodestone with which he attracted his accounts of other, more deeply traumatised refugees, so his wandering through a contemporary world at once jumbled with the hypertrophy of civilisation - the architectural historian Jacques Austerlitz's hated giganticism - and curiously devoid of its citizens is itself a metaphor for the Holocaust. Then again, why not view Sebald's preoccupation with miniaturising as part of his rejection of the sensible in favour of the intelligible? Besides, I myself, a half-Jew, have on my visits to Vienna, where Sebald's alter ego suffers his vertiginous nervous breakdown, been afflicted by an oppressive sense of the absence of those most instrumental in the character of its built environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Sebald's preoccupation with traffic - its melding of flesh and metal - what committed walker is unaware of the extent to which car drivers are utterly unaware of him? Although few could repay them as elegantly as he does, by doling out this coinage: "For some time now I have been convinced that it is out of this din that the life is being born which will come after us and will spell our gradual destruction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet this isn't enough - it is my reversal of Schopenhauer's dictum that holds true for Sebald; for here is a writer who manifestly loves men and women, loves them by lavishing on them the caress of a faithful ear. The individuals to whom Sebald devotes space and time are vitally incarnate - that is why we can feel so intensely the mental disintegration of the eponymous emigrants and of Austerlitz - but mankind itself, if not hated, is much less loved, and pushed firmly out of focus. Is it accidental that both of Sebald's descriptions of the Nazis' ghettoisation of the Jews - in The Emigrants and Austerlitz - dwell so obsessively on the density of these environments, the way in which a mass of people were crushed into a small space? It's difficult not to hear De Quincey, tormented by his dreams of the orient, and writing of Indochina that "the human being is in these parts a weed".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is strange that such a solipsistic "I" should also be a triumphantly synoptic eye, for Sebald's most notable achievment is to give his readers the impression that he has placed before them everything that he himself has perceived. The clarity of his language (and here, as a monoglot, I should properly be praising only the clarity of his translators' language) renders Sebald's looping and discursive prose highly legible; yet those long sentences that seem to spiral up and down in space, and back and forth in time, are also reticulated, capturing within their mesh a shoal of factoids, aper&amp;ccedil;us and asides - the mental breakdown of Schumann, the life cycle of the silkworm, the desuetude of the Manchester ship canal, Welsh conceptions of second sight, and so on. Like those paintings of the early Renaissance in which perspective is still in the service of comprehension rather than visual fidelity, Sebald's Weltan-schauung is ranged before us, with a clearly delineated foreground, backed by tier upon tier of niches and grottos, replete with figures at once hieratic and alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, the writer seems to be telling us, is what was - and yet such a synoptic view is quite impossible. Besides, at every turn, Sebald confounds his own achievement and occludes his own clarity: the dead are not dead, time is inconsistent - no river running smoothly from past to future, but eddies and crosscurrents of chronology - while coincidences are none the less hugely significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, reading Sebald feels like the literary equivalent of watching that famous shot in Jaws - tracking forward, while zooming out - when Police Chief Brody is dragged into the terror of a shark attack. (This track forward, reverse zoom shot was first used by Hitchcock in his own Vertigo.) It is exhilarating, certainly, but once you begin to scrutinise it - and how I wish I hadn't - the awareness that one is being manipulated becomes inescapable. Why spend time with a writer who you have accused of melancholia, misanthropy and manipulation? The answer is that ineluctably burgeoning affinity I described at the outset. Sebald was not that hateful thing, a merely good or serviceable writer - he was a great one, and to paraphrase Anthony Powell, even with great writers there's a lot one has to put up with. So, while I did not know Sebald at all, I feel painfully close to his alter ego. What fiction offers us is an intimacy shorn of the messy contingencies of human existence - gender, race, class or age. Those moments of transcendence when we exclaim "You know exactly what I mean!" depend for much of their force on the anonymous character of the intimacy between writer and reader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Sebald's alter ego appears to violate this bond. His readers are given, quite shamelessly, to understand that he is an academic, that he teaches at UEA, that he was born in Wertach im Allg&amp;auml;u in the Bavarian Alps, and came to Manchester in 1966. The paradox goes deeper, because while the circumstantial evidence for "WG Sebald" is presented quite clearly in the four books, the man himself remains curiously elusive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we base our understanding of Sebald the man on the four books alone, we are left not much the wiser. Here we have a bien-pensant of a certain age, peripatetic although with an aversion to the morbid extravagances of late 20th-century travel, a solitary man who yet nurtures close friendships, an emotional person who is nevertheless deeply repressed (in the four contemporary works there are only two descriptions of sex, both voyeuristic) - and so on. In other words, just as Sebald's quasi-fictionalised "characters" speak to us only by throwing their voices into his alter ego's cave of a psyche, so the alter ego himself seems like an echo of a person, rather than the real being. Think of Tennyson's "Maud": "And Echo there, whatever is asked her, answers 'Death'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helped that I was able to accompany Sebald's alter ego through a landscape I have known since early childhood: the north Suffolk coast. It helped still more that I was living there, in melancholic seclusion, at exactly the same time that Sebald took the walk on which he draped the brocaded prose of The Rings of Saturn. The compound eye of the Sizewell B nuclear reactor, the strange labyrinthine waste of heather and bracken that is Dunwich Heath - even the low and crumbling cliffs up towards Benacre, where his alter ego was revolted by the corpse-like flexing of a couple making love - these are all places I've been to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, also, it helped that I had a relationship with the Holocaust that was defined by emigration, displacement and denial: my mother, both rejecting her own Jewishness and speaking of the letters relatives would send to the United States during the war asking for money; letters she later learned the Nazis forced them to write. Then there was the old Polish lady who lived at the end of the block, and who allowed her privet hedges to become more and more overgrown because, my mother maintained, she believed that the Nazis - motorised columns of deathly angels - would thereby pass over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was my sauntering up to Sebald with this sense of a direct correspondence that made me impatient with those commentators who were flummoxed by what genre his works belonged to. These were picaresques, pure and simple: the journeys were the foundation of all the tales, the embellishments - personal, anecdotal, historical - came along the way, called forth by incidents on the road. With The Rings of Saturn this is obvious enough, but it holds good for the other books, and if we take them in the chronological order of their composition, it can be seen that Vertigo, with its pained traverse of Europe - whether now, or then, or then again - stands as the paradigmatic Sebald text. The rest are rewrites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm getting ahead of myself, for this is a conclusion I had already reached before I read Vertigo. My growing sense of affinity with Sebald's alter ego was based in part on my own increasingly picaresque pieces of writing: I walked, I drove, I flew, I walked again - then I wrote it up. And also on my increasingly Sebaldian alter ego: I was closing on the age at which he had begun to write his picaresques, I was a middle-aged man with minimal baggage, few accessories, and a growing loathing of computers. When I walked, I too found it difficult to bridge the gap between the reeling and spooling of my internal discourse and the curiously dwarfish people I came upon. As for the douceur de la vie, well, I have it in spades, natch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My decision to "reverse engineer" a Sebaldian piece of writing was an obvious one: I had a similar sensibility already, all I had to do was to take it for a walk and see what it came up with. Or, rather, send it for a walk, in the same fashion that Sebald had projected his alter ego, so that he was able to accompany Marie Henri Beyle over the St Bernard pass, or Great-Uncle Adelwarth and Cosmo Solomon on their grand tour, or Austerlitz's mother, Agat&amp;aacute;, to the hideous ghetto at Terezin, or Austerlitz himself on the kindertransport. But as soon as I happened on this idea, it began to make me feel uneasy. If I were to fictively describe a journey I was yet to take, who knew what might happen when I actually undertook it? Was this not the most sublime form of tempting fate? As Austerlitz himself echoed in the psychic cave of Sebald's alter ego: "It seems to me as if all the moments of our life occupy the same space, as if future events already existed and were only waiting for us to find our way to them at last . . ." Here I was driving these events out of hiding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was all more disturbing than I could have hoped for. I decided to spend three days walking along the Holderness coast of East Yorkshire, from Flamborough Head in the north to Spurn Head in the south. This, the fastest-eroding coastline in Europe, loses anything up to three metres of its clayey cliff edge every year; since the Roman conquest, scores of villages and a number of significant towns have slid into the oblivion of what was once known as the German Ocean. "Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh", cries Northumberland in act two, scene one of Richard II - but it's Ravenspurgh itself that's now gone away. What could be more Sebaldian than this territorial disappearing act, this annihilation of a shoreline? And how much stranger that there was so little about it in the popular English consciousness; all I could recall was Michael Barratt on Nationwide when I was a child. He's in the television studio, with his 1970s coif, a melting dollop of ice-creamy hair dripping across his forehead. Meanwhile, via a live link to Skipsea on the Holderness coast, he interviews a man who stands in half a conservatory, bellyaching: "I can't oonderstand it, I oonly poot those UPV windows in last year - and now look at them!" What could be the explanation for this Canute-like collective denial, save that, reeling already from the political diminution of their once mighty empire, the Lilliputian English could not bear to contemplate the whittling away of their isle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I sat in my room in London, assembling the materials I would need to create a virtual walking tour of the Holderness coast, I found myself, unbidden, experiencing a diminution of my own, as my psyche shrugged off the extraneous layer of bodily affect, and became a sea-polished shell pulled by the tidal crowd across London to King's Cross, where it got on the train to York. Naturally - or, rather, unnaturally - this process was articulated on the page as amnesia: "When I came to consider the matter, the truth was that my memory had been fraying at the edges for some time; the grey waters of Lethe undercutting its soft cliffs, so that my bungaloid recollections - which, no matter how tasteless, had the virtue of being owned outright, not mortgaged - tumbled on to the beach below."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An amnesia, furthermore, that was combined with a terrible disorientation: "Rounding the corner by Wellington's house at Number One, London, I would find myself in uncharted waters, with pigeons and gulls wheeling insultingly overhead. That middle-aged Italian couple - he with sprinkling of salt-and-pepper beard, she sporting a youthful cropped T-shirt and with a bum like a bum bag - would it be too strange to ask them if I might consult the map they held open between them? For I no longer knew my way around this city."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there was the photograph, which I picked up from the gutter outside my son's school early on during my experiment: "It was a black and white scrap, the top right-hand corner, suggesting that the whole thing had been torn in half, then in half again. I seized upon it - as if it might be a clue of a special kind. Not that it portrayed anything at all remarkable: only most of the head of a fleshy-faced white man in his mid-thirties; a man who had a scraggy beard that hung to the bottom of his chin, and whose bare scalp was outflanking on both sides his attempt at a quiff. He looked amiable enough - or harmless until proved psychopathic by the legwork the clue seemed to demand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could go on - but it isn't necessary; anyone who has accompanied Sebald's fictive alter ego on his travels knows what to expect. Suffice to say, the reverse engineering worked, and having sent my own fictive alter ego walking along the collapsing cliffs of the Holderness coast, by the time my actual body arrived, it found the streets of Bridlington - normally thronged with holidaymakers during July - curiously empty. Moreover, as I plodded for mile after mile, I found myself in the uncanny position of activating those events that my alter ego had left, like psychic mantraps, waiting for me. Consider the hunter Gracchus, not as he is reanimated in Sebald's Vertigo, but as he speaks for himself, albeit through the ventriloquism of Franz Kafka: "I am forever on the great stairway that leads up to the world. On that infinitely wide and open stairway I clamber about, sometimes up, sometimes down, sometimes on the right, sometimes on the left, always in motion. But when I soar up with a supreme effort and can already see the gate shining above me, I wake up on my old boat, still forlornly stranded in some earthly sea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I came to Vertigo myself, then read the interviews conducted with Sebald and collected in the volume entitled The Emergence of Memory, it was with that same sense of deliberately engineered d&amp;eacute;j&amp;agrave; vu that I had experienced trudging the subsiding loess of the Holderness coast. Sebald speaks of his own methodology in spatial terms: "If you are travelling along the road and things come in from the sides to offer themselves, then you're going in the right direction. If nothing comes, you are barking up the wrong tree." Then again: "We're living exactly on the borderline between the natural world . . . and that other world which is generated by our brain cells. And so clearly that fault line runs through our physical and emotional makeup . . . where these tectonic plates rub against each other [are] the sources of pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't surprised, either, to find this, Sebald's rebuttal of any taint of douceur de la vie in his work: "The old-fashionedness of the . . . narrative tone is . . . nothing to do with nostalgia for a better age . . . but simply something that . . . heightens the awareness of that which we have managed to engineer in this century." But when I reached another remark of Sebald's - "This notion of the autonomous individual who is in charge of his or her fate is one that I couldn't really subscribe to" - I only cried out: "You know exactly what I mean!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/wgsebald"&gt;WG Sebald&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/willself"&gt;Will Self&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/fiction"&gt;Fiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>The great crash</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2009/feb/07/josiah-wedgwood-ceramics-susan-williams</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/1828?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Art+and+design%3A+The+great+crash&amp;ch=Art+and+design&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Heritage+%28Art+and+design%29%2CDesign+%28Art+and+design%29%2CArt+and+design&amp;c5=Art%2CDesign&amp;c6=Jenny+Uglow&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1164700&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Art+and+design&amp;c12=Heritage&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FArt+and+design%2FHeritage" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the crash of banks and the cascade of lost jobs in recent weeks, there have been moments when history has seemed to roll back, making one draw breath in astonishment. One was the announcement that interest rates were the lowest since the founding of the Bank of England in 1694. Another was the news that Waterford Wedgwood had been put into receivership, with debts in the millions. The news about Wedgwood struck me sharply, because for all his faults and foibles, the firm's founder, Josiah Wedgwood, has always been one of my heroes. He was a force of unstoppable energy, funny and fierce, tender to his family and ruthlessly determined in business. He also combined a set of qualities rarely found in a single person: a genius for chemistry, a passion for good design, a daring, innovative style in manufacturing and a genius for marketing. Without his marketing flair and keen eye for spotting new trends, all his other talents would have meant little. And it is perhaps the firm's slowness to adapt to changing lifestyles that has caused Wedgwood's collapse today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Josiah Wedgwood's achievement is intimately bound up with the history of the Potteries. For 200 years before he was born, in the villages of north Staffordshire, potters had been using the local clay to make marbled and mottled ware, selling their pitchers and patterned plates at nearby markets. His family had been potters around Stoke-on-Trent and Burslem for three generations, and his uncles had already made a fortune from their hard, salt-glazed stoneware. When he was 28, on May Day 1759, Josiah rented the Ivy House Works in Burslem from his uncle John and set out on his own. He was already known for his innovation, especially for his popular "greengrocery", using rich green and yellow glazes on pots in the shape of cauliflowers and pineapples, artichokes and melons. Wedgwood was always on the lookout for promising new inventions that could be turned to use. From 1761 he sent pots to Liverpool to be decorated by the new transfer printing process. His vivid printed plates and cups, with landscapes and birds, lovers and heroes, ships and emblems, brought colour and life to the dressers of the new, prosperous "middling classes" of Britain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Wedgwood was aiming higher. He married his cousin Sally, and put her dowry to good use in renting more space. His skill as a chemist had led to the introduction of his pearly "creamware", which caught the attention of the local aristocracy, and in early 1765, to his stunned delight, he received an order for a tea set for Queen Charlotte, with candlesticks and fruit baskets, "with a gold ground and raised flowers upon it in green". The gilding was costly and the commission daunting - the sensible Stoke potters had turned it down. (This is a dilemma that many of them face today: the research and launch of a new dinner service can bankrupt a company if it isn't a hit.) But Wedgwood set off for court dressed in his best clothes, came home and roused his workmen, and completed the tea set on time. He was lucky: the Queen liked it. So, very cannily, he sent her some patterns and vases. Not only did he win permission to call himself "Potter to Her Majesty", but his creamware was given the title Queen's Ware. Two years later, he wrote to his partner Thomas Bentley that he was amazed how fast its use had spread, "and how universally it is liked. How much of this general use and estimation is owing to the mode of its introduction - and how much to its real utility and beauty?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next problem was how to expand and get these beautiful things to distant markets. The roads were terrible, rutted and hard as iron in summer, slippery with mud in autumn and winter, and many pots were smashed by the time they reached Chester, the nearest port. Wedgwood fought for better turnpikes and led the campaign to build the Trent-Mersey canal. In this, and in his neatly recorded chemical experiments, he was helped by his friends in the Lunar Society of Birmingham, including Erasmus Darwin, James Watt and Matthew Boulton. (Wedgwood's son Robert married Darwin's daughter Susanna.) Boulton's revolutionary "manufactory" inspired Wedgwood's new factory, Etruria, which opened with a grand celebration in 1766. Etruria was a harbinger of the dreaded factories of later years, with its stern rules about conduct and its pioneering system of clocking on, but in its day it was a model, with housing for workers, a school and a health insurance scheme, and the workforce stayed for years. Wedgwood remained a hands-on manager. A bout of smallpox endured as a boy affected his joints and left him with a limp, and he was famous for using his stick to smash anything under par, exclaiming it was "not good enough for Josiah Wedgwood".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also opened showrooms in London, cleverly designed so that visiting them became a fashionable thing to do, in line with attending public art exhibitions. He wanted a "Large" room, he said, in order to "do the needful with the Ladys in the neatest, genteelest and best method. And besides room for my Ware, I must have room for my Ladys for they sometimes come in very large shoals together."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Year by year, Wedgwood's business expanded. He was always experimenting. He tried hard, like his contemporaries in the trade, to find the secret of fine Chinese porcelain, but in the meantime developed new ceramic bodies - such as his black basalt in 1768 and the famous jasper, after years of trials, in 1774. In that year came his first international triumph, a dinner service for Catherine the Great, bearing the emblem of a frog, as it was destined for La Grenouill&amp;egrave;re palace in St Petersburg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The astonishing 1,200 pieces of the "Frog Service" showed British scenes - from contemporary landscape gardens to the wild Fingal's Cave, from Celtic dolmens to Coalbrookdale ironworks. But the name of his factory, Etruria, suggested by Erasmus Darwin, pointed to Wedgwood's greatest ambition: to make ornamental vases that rivalled those of the ancient world. His inspiration came from the collection of Sir William Hamilton, based on finds at Pompeii and Herculaneum, which started a "vase mania". Wedgwood joked that he hoped to be "Vase Maker General to the Universe", and when Bentley suggested they compete with French products, which were the height of luxury, he replied in excitement: "Conquer France in Burslem? My blood moves quicker, I feel my strength increase for the contest." They would make pots, he said, that would "captivate them with the Elegance and simplicitie of the Ancients". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the first, he nurtured local designers such as William Hackwood, who modelled bas-reliefs and portrait busts for jasper cameos; he used Thomas Bewick's minutely observed vignettes on his creamware; he cultivated fashionable amateurs such as Lady Templetown, Emma Crewe and Lady Diana Beauclerk, whose studies of women and children appealed to the new "feminine" market. Professional artists also worked for him, including John Flaxman, whose ravishing classical reliefs included the Apotheosis of Homer, adapted from a vase in the British Museum. It was Flaxman who prompted Wedgwood to undertake the copy of the Portland Vase, exhibited in London in 1790. George Stubbs designed plaques, such as The Lion and Horse, to repay Wedgwood's long, difficult work in perfecting the great ceramic plaques that he wanted for his experimental enamels. Artists helped to spread the Wedgwood legend. In Penelope Unravelling her Web by Lamplight and The Corinthian Maid, Joseph Wright of Derby, a friend of the Lunar circle, dutifully linked pottery-making with classical myth and domestic virtue. Two decades later, Benjamin West's painting Etruria, or British Manufacture (1791) took Wedgwood's work as a symbol of the rebirth of the arts in England, showing one of his classical nymphs carrying the Portland Vase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through this blend of art and science and commerce, Wedgwood was at the cutting edge of British culture. After he died in 1796, the family firm kept up the connection with artists. Like other Stoke potteries, the company began producing bone china, bringing in new designs to fit changing tastes, from curly chinoiserie to elegant pure white with smart gold rims for regency breakfast sets. And the personal touch remained important. In the early 19th century, Josiah Wedgwood II - one of the founders of the Royal Horticultural Society - and his brother John introduced designs based on botanical illustrations, including the famous Water Lily pattern: Robert Darwin, father of Charles, was one of the first to order a set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stoke's many potteries survived slumps and depressions by relying on boldness in design. In the 1870s, Walter Crane produced an extraordinary Wedgwood design of winged archers and horses aptly called Ambition. After the first world war came the glowing lustreware of Daisy Makeig-Jones, including her whimsical Fairyland Lustre. The glum 1930s saw stunning designs from Rex Whistler and Eric Ravilious. The latter's ABC series and witty designs based on regency gardening implements brought a new exhilaration and inspiration. In the same decade, Susie Cooper started her company, designing every pattern in the range herself; this range, too, eventually became part of Wedgwood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media reports of the Waterford Wedgwood collapse have been elegiac and doom-laden. But might old JW have found a sunnier side? The Design Museum in London recently hosted a debate about the ceramic industry, asking what had gone wrong, and where the future lies. In the words of the organiser Michael Czerwinski, himself a potter, the people of Stoke-on-Trent are understandably worried, but the fault is not with their lack of imagination: "There is a strong movement in Stoke to absorb new creative talent and it is only commercial restraints that are holding them back." But British companies such as Wedgwood do seem backward-looking, belonging to a posher era of dinner parties and tea sets. Most people, as Czerwinski says, identify them with "fancy heritage-ware for the export market" or the kind of "aspirational dinner services" that one might give as wedding presents, but would never want to own oneself.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, in recent years, Wedgwood has been surprisingly courageous. The company has worked, for example, with experimental ceramic artists such as Clare Twomey, who caused a stir in September 2006 with her show Trophy, in which 4,000 blue Wedgwood birds, scattered around the Victoria and Albert Museum, were gradually pocketed and taken home by visitors. In the end, the whole flock vanished. Stamps on the back of the birds led to hundreds of emails to the V&amp;A, Wedgwood and the artist from as far away as the States and Australia, and the strange event raised questions about value, desirability, heritage and temptation of the kind that Josiah himself would recognise. Twomey raves about the Wedgwood team: "I can't say enough about their support and enthusiasm - my stuff is pushing the borders, yet they fully embraced it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Wedgwood and other companies have failed to embrace is the change in the way that we live. The Design Museum is currently showing Pottery Goes Pop, a display of the 1960s works of Susan Williams-Ellis, the founder of Portmeirion Pottery. The daughter of Clough Williams-Ellis, the creator of the crazily eclectic Italianate village in north Wales, she was as unconventional as Wedgwood - a "free spirit", as the curator Gemma Curtin puts it. She grew up, like Wedgwood, with an appreciation of the traditions of the craft. Her mother, Anna, was the cousin of Lytton Strachey, and she was born in 1918 in the house of Roger Fry, the art critic, painter and founder of the Omega Workshops. As a schoolgirl at Dartington, she was taught to throw pots by the studio potters Bernard and David Leach, and she went on to study painting at Chelsea Polytechnic under Graham Sutherland and Henry Moore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before she turned to ceramics, Williams-Ellis worked as an illustrator and a textile designer, but she also had sound commercial sense. Like Wedgwood, she transformed a traditional Stoke-on-Trent works, Kirkham Pottery, by introducing modern production methods, exchanging the old coal-fired bottle kiln for an electric one. She made all the moulds from which the factory's pottery was produced; in a brilliant stroke of improvisation, she picked up some old cylindrical moulds that the Kirkham works had used for making laboratory equipment and turned them into a tall, thin coffee pot - an entirely new shape. Then she carved bold, primitive patterns on the pots, glazed them in blue, dark green or dusky gold and named them Totem - a new style was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams-Ellis translated images from the past and other cultures, particularly from South America and Greece, into the bold colours, layered glazes and dramatic forms beloved of Swinging London. A decade later, she found herself entranced by a herbal of 1817 that she had stumbled across in an antiquarian bookshop. Ignoring the accepted wisdom that all parts of a dinner service or new design should match, she launched her Botanic Garden range with 28 different botanical designs surrounded by a single border. She had a world bestseller on her hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And like Wedgwood, Williams-Ellis combined this idiosyncratic yet commercial aesthetic with a democratic determination to produce what she called "good, functional designs that were practical, beautiful and affordable". She died in 2007, aged 89, still passionately interested in the future of pottery and in innovatory design. These two entrepreneurs, 200 years apart, show that bold design, combined with sensitivity to new ideas in how people want to live their lives, can be a recipe for success. And although the current climate discourages daring, the will and potential are still present in the Potteries: this is vividly displayed, for example, in the plans for the British ceramics biennial, being held in Stoke this year. All that is lacking is the capital that gives companies time to develop new ideas. There are rumours that Wedgwood will be able to continue in business, rather than disappearing for ever. If we insist on looking backwards, yearning for the past glories of Wedgwood and ignoring what potters are trying to do now in terms of design, we are in danger, as Czerwinski says, "of neglecting something very important, happening under our noses".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/heritage"&gt;Heritage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/design"&gt;Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/56537?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Life+and+style%3A+Sounds+fishy&amp;ch=Life+and+style&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Shellfish+%28recipes%29%2CFood+and+drink+%28Life+and+style%29%2CPork+%28recipes%29%2CVegetables+%28recipes%29%2CSoup+%28recipes%29%2CLife+and+style&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CFood+and+Drink&amp;c6=Hugh+Fearnley-Whittingstall&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1164004&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Life+and+style&amp;c12=Shellfish+recipes&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FLife+and+style%2FShellfish+recipes" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can clearly remember the first time I was struck by the genius of combining shellfish with pork. It was in a little Portuguese restaurant in west London, which is sadly no longer there. I had porco &amp;agrave; alentejana - clams with salt pork, or thereabouts. It's one of those culinary revelations when you think, "Yes! This really works. It will therefore be a recurring pleasure from now until the end of my days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No less memorable was the first time I dabbled with the combo in my own kitchen. It was with the first ever batch of homemade chorizo made from my first ever home-reared pigs. And with some razor clams gathered at a particularly low spring tide. With the friendly guidance of local fisherman Bill Sales, now sadly no longer with us, I learned the trick of identifying the needle-eye blowholes of these succulent, sand-burrowing clams. And I learned how to coax them to the surface by tipping a little pile of salt on top of the hole, and sluicing it down with a squirt of sea water from a Fairy Liquid bottle. Eight times out of 10, after a delay of 30 seconds or so, the indignant clams shoot to the surface, an inch or two of their cut-throat shell protruding above the sand. You have to be quick, but canny. Delay, and they'll shoot back down. Pull too fast or too hard, and you'll tear them, leaving the juicy, muscular foot, which is the prime eating, behind under the sand. You have to hold on, tweaking and pulling them firmly but not violently. Sooner or later, one of your pulls will coincide with a moment of muscle relaxation on the part of the clam, and the prize will be yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at home, slices of the chorizo went into the frying pan and were sizzled until crispy. Then a splash of wine and a knob of butter. And when that was all bubbling, in went the clams, on went a lid, and they were steamed open for a couple of minutes. The whole sweet, salty, spicy pile, running with paprika- and garlic-flavoured oily juices from the highly spiced sausage, was attacked with fingers and bread. It was, and is, unbelievably good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pork/shellfish combo is now a central part of the River Cottage repertoire, something we turn to in the colder months when local shellfish are at their plump, juicy best. Squid, scallops, oysters and mussels have all had the chorizo and/or bacon treatment, and all caused great delight in those who have man-handled them into their mouths. Incidentally, the old adage that you should eat oysters only when there's an "r" in the month is a pretty good guide for other bivalves, too. Most clams, cockles and mussels spawn in summer, so February is a good time to feast upon them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the best results in such dishes, make sure you use "cooking" chorizo, which is quite soft and lightly cured, rather than the firm, dry, long-cured "slicing" sausage. That said, at River Cottage we make our own chorizo for cooking. It's such a simple and satisfying process that I'd encourage you to do the same. You don't even have to make it into a sausage, just store the mix in a Tupperware tub in the fridge, where it will keep happily for at least a week, then break off little chunks for cooking with your shellfish. (Or eggs, or potatoes, or bread, or chicken...) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tupperware Chorizo with clams and purple-sprouting broccoli&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My latest take on the Portuguese clams-and-sausage combo, delicious with the year's first sprouting broccoli. Serves four as a starter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the chorizo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;750g pork belly, coarsely minced&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 tbsp sweet smoked paprika&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 tsp hot smoked paprika&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 garlic cloves, finely chopped&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 tbsp sea salt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;frac12;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; tsp fennel seeds, lightly toasted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;frac14;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; tsp cayenne pepper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50ml red wine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freshly ground black pepper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To cook the dish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;150g purple sprouting broccoli&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 tbsp olive oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;400-500g clams, scrubbed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freshly ground black pepper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squeeze of lemon juice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make the chorizo, combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix with your hands. Heat a little oil in a frying pan, make a small patty of the mixture and fry on each side for a few minutes, until cooked through. Taste for seasoning and adjust accordingly - the flavours develop as the mix matures, so go easy. Cover and store in the fridge for at least 24 hours (and up to a week). You won't need more than a handful for this dish; use the rest to add spicy, savoury bite to all manner of dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bring a pan of salted water to the boil, cook the broccoli for two minutes, then drain and set aside. Heat a large, heavy-based frying pan over a high heat, add the oil and about 150g of the chorizo mix, broken into pieces the size of a walnut. Fry for three to four minutes, stirring as the meat releases its salty, spicy fat, until it starts to crisp up. Move the chorizo to one side of the pan, check the pan is still really hot, then add the clams. Cover, rattle the pan and leave for a couple of minutes, until the shells open. Remove the lid, add the broccoli and cook for another minute, tossing regularly, so everything gets coated in the fat. Season with pepper and lemon juice (the chorizo is already salty), then tip on to warmed plates. Eat with chunks of bread to mop up the juices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Steamed mussels with sausage and a&amp;Iuml;oli&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a traditional recipe from S&amp;egrave;te in the south-west of France, in which raw mussels are stuffed with pork, closed with string and cooked in a tomato sauce. It's a lot of work, so I've simplified it. Serves two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20g butter &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 medium onion, finely chopped&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 leek, white part only, finely sliced&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 tbsp thyme leaves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;200g herby sausages, casings removed, broken into 2cm pieces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 tbsp chopped fresh marjoram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;400g tin chopped tomatoes &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;120ml dry white wine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1kg mussels, well scrubbed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salt and freshly ground black pepper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the a&amp;iuml;oli&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 cloves garlic, chopped&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pinch of flaky sea salt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 egg yolks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 tsp mustard...#8805;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A sprinkling of ground white pepper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;200ml olive oil (not extra-virgin)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 tbsp lemon juice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make the a&amp;iuml;oli first. With the flat of a large knife, work the garlic and salt into a paste, then scrape into a bowl. Add the yolks, mustard and pepper, whisk, then add the oil a drop or two at a time, whisking vigorously as you go. When you've used about 20ml of the oil, start to drip in a little more at a time. After you've used 100ml of oil, whisk in half the lemon juice - this will turn the mayo much paler. Now add the oil a little more quickly, whisking as you go. When all the oil is incorporated, add the second tablespoon of lemon juice. Taste the a&amp;iuml;oli, and season to taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melt the butter in a large, heavy-based frying pan over medium-low heat. Add the onion, leek and thyme. Saut&amp;eacute; gently until the vegetables begin to soften, about 10 minutes, then add the sausage and cook, stirring frequently, for five minutes, until lightly coloured. Stir in the marjoram, tomatoes and wine. Raise the heat, bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Add the mussels, cover and cook until they open (discard any that don't) - three to four minutes. Season to taste. Divide between two warmed bowls, sprinkle with parsley and serve with the a&amp;iuml;oli and good crusty bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shellfish chowder with Bacon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loosely inspired by the clam chowders of New England, this one uses stock, instead of the more traditional milk. Serves four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 tbsp olive oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 knobs of unsalted butter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;150g smoked bacon (or pancetta), cut into small cubes or lardons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 onion, diced&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 large leek, white part only, quartered lengthwise and sliced thin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 small garlic cloves, finely chopped&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 large, waxy potato (such as Cara), peeled and cut into 5mm cubes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;750ml fish stock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1kg cockles (or small clams such as palourdes)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 glass white wine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50ml double cream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salt and freshly ground black pepper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 tbsp chopped parsley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put a large, heavy-based saucepan on a medium-high heat, add the oil and a knob of butter, and saut&amp;eacute; the bacon until it releases some fat. Add the onion, leek and garlic; cover and sweat for five minutes, without letting them colour. Add the potato, cook for five minutes more, add the stock and bring to a gentle simmer. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, until the potato is tender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, scrub the cockles under cold water, discarding any that are damaged or open. Put a large, wide pan on a high heat, add the wine, a glass of water and a knob of butter, and bring to a boil. Add the cockles and cover. After a minute or so, shake the pan, cover again and cook for two to four minutes, until the cockles open (discard any that do not). Tip the pan into a colander placed over a bowl to catch the juices. Set aside a few cockles and pick the rest from their shells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strain the juices through a fine sieve and add to the chowder, along with the shelled cockles.

      <title>I discovered my wife's affair</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/feb/07/relationship-breakdown-adultery</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/87731?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Life+and+style%3A+I+read+about+my+wife%27s+affair+in+her+diary&amp;ch=Life+and+style&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Relationships+%28Life+and+style%29%2CLife+and+style&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CFamily+and+Relationships&amp;c6=Anonymous&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1163978&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Life+and+style&amp;c12=Relationships&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FLife+and+style%2FRelationships" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't remember the exact day Colin (not his real name) became part of my life. A fleetingly glimpsed neighbour I'd sometimes nod to, I knew he was a long-distance truck driver and I think he knew who I was. When our paths crossed, he would seldom meet my gaze. I don't even remember when I first heard his name. A familiar voice uttered it, though: my wife's. It wasn't by way of an introduction, although years later I did wonder how that might have gone. "Honey, you've seen that handsome man with the blond hair, broad shoulders and light tan who lives at number 18? His name's Colin." But no. Rather more mundanely, she referred to him matter-of-factly in conversation. "Colin took the remains of that old fence to the dump for me today, honey." Or, "Oh, by the way, Colin mended the lawn mower. Then he mowed the lawn." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colin was indeed the helpful friend who lived down the road. It is easier now to see that he was a more astute people-watcher than he seemed. He must have known that my job often took me abroad, and he probably had me profiled as a workaholic, as insensitive to my wife's needs as I was trusting of her fidelity. By then we'd been married for some time and had two young children. While I was away, my wife stayed at home taking care of the kids. I thought we were happy but, in truth, I was too wrapped up in my job to know. Life went on. And secretly, day by day, it was written down: my wife was a meticulous diarist and spent 20 minutes every evening logging the day's events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One afternoon I walked into our bedroom and noticed she'd left her diary on the bed. This was unusual but, stranger still, it was open. I went to put it in her bedside drawer, but as I closed the pages I caught sight of the word "Colin". My immediate impulse was to slam the diary shut and try to forget I'd seen his name before it had a chance to sink in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, I started to read. The entries stretched back months, detailing their covert liaisons - romantic, practical, but mostly sexual. The descriptions ranged from the relatively tame ("Kissed and cuddled today, it was lovely") to the kind of things you get in the racier passages of a Mills &amp; Boon novel - nothing too graphic, but surprisingly comprehensive. My jaw ached with panic and I felt the sudden flush of adrenaline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I confronted her. I wanted to yell at her, but my initial anger was quickly anaesthetised by shock. I felt numb, confused. With tears in her eyes, she said she hadn't been happy for years and that Colin provided an escape. At that moment, I didn't know what to say. It was four or five hours before we could sit down and talk. We discussed the usual options, including divorce, but decided to stay together for the sake of the children, make a fresh start. Next day, she told Colin it was over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn't see him for a couple of weeks after that - he'd been driving his lorry on the continent. But Colin never did return. The news that he had gone missing on a ship, presumed lost overboard, was broken to us by his next-door neighbour. My wife's first reaction was stunned disbelief, as was mine. Then she turned away and covered her mouth, trying to stifle any sobs. Thoughts and emotions more tangled than ever, I tried to comfort her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colin's death was confirmed by the positive identification of a body washed up on the beach. Some weeks later, my wife asked if we could drive to the crematorium so she could lay some flowers and say her final farewells. It felt strange but, in the hope of her finding some kind of closure, I told myself it was the right thing to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, and completely irrationally, I felt involved in Colin's death, as if a personal timeline had been derailed on my behalf and destiny rewritten to rescue a failing relationship. Slowly we tried to put it behind us and his name was never mentioned again. A few years later we had another child and our marriage entered a new, happier phase. I vowed to be a more attentive husband and adjust my work-life balance. But I couldn't forget the affair, especially how close it had happened to home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should have trusted my instinct: 12 years later, my wife ran off with my best friend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Do you have an experience to share?

      <title>Music Weekly</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/audio/2009/feb/06/music-weekly-podcast-emerson-nasa</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week's Music Weekly kicks off with globetrotting DJ Darren Emerson, the man who helped put Underworld on the map with their stunning single Born Slippy. Emerson tells Paul MacInnes all about how Grandmaster Flash and Detroit house shaped his love of dance music, how Karl Hyde and Rick Smith gave him stage presence, and how the spate of MTV-led dance videos with nothing but ladies in bikinis depresses him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandwhiched in between is our favourite type of filling: Singles Club. New Band of the Day's Paul Lester and guardian.co.uk/music's Tim Jonze join forces with Rosie Swash to discuss the latest tracks from Australian prog-electro duo Empire of the Sun, "Brooklyn Banshees" Telepathe, and New York twee-sters the Pains of Being Pure at Heart. Lester waxes lyrical about bands with vision, but do we really need more multi-media manifestos in pop? And have Telepathe got mileage or are they all scene and no substance? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Rosie meets the duo behind the international, genre-spanning NASA (North America South America) and finds out why it took Squeak E Clean and DJ Zegon six years to make their debut album (hint: it's got everyone under sun on it, including one of the last recordings Ol' Dirty Bastard ever made). Plus, the feature that remains nameless takes a nostalgic look at the close-harmony singing of the Everly Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

The only thing they had shared before last week was sitting their final secondary school exams. They come from different areas and their villages are a distance apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, in a room serving as a community resource centre in Katine, north-east Uganda, they are seated side by side being taught basic computer skills, along with two local boys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the first beneficiaries of the community room that has been set up at the offices of the African Medical and Research Foundation (Amref) in the sub-county, as part of the Katine community partnership project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long awaited facility, which is meant to familiarise Katine villagers with computers and help them find out more about the project, has been received with excitement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had never touched a computer before. I am excited to have the opportunity," Akino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group was introduced to the basics of using Word and Excel, and understanding how to use email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I now have an email address and also can communicate through the internet. It was interesting to learn about things we had never been introduced to," Akino added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main group of people to be trained are teachers, health workers, and sub-county extension workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Opesen, Amref's empowerment officer, says it is hoped the community resources centre will provide villagers with an avenue through which they can share their thoughts on the issues affecting them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This holistic approach to community-based development will ensure sustainability through empowering the community to engage in local governance," said Opesen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opportunities to use computers are rare in communities as remote as Katine. IT is widely seen as the reserve of the affluent living in urban areas who can afford lessons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computer skills training in Uganda is too expensive to be accessed by poor communities such as Katine. An average package of IT lessons costs at least Uganda shillings (Shs) 50,000 (about $25).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The training Akino and her group received at the community centre would usually cost at least Shs 150, 000 (about $75).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, IT training won't be easy for illiterate community members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illiteracy levels in Katine are poor and have been estimated by the district education office to be around 60%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The centre might not benefit everybody in Katine, but at least a specific portion of the population," Opesen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Villagers will, at least, have had some exposure to the IT world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/governance"&gt;Governance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/empowerment"&gt;Empowerment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/amref"&gt;Katine amref&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/news"&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/uganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

The financial sector will pay itself &amp;pound;3.6bn in bonuses this month: banks are rumoured to be rushing to beat any proposed cap. Even 70% state-owned RBS will pay generously, despite losing &amp;pound;28bn at the blackjack tables of investment banking. The government braces itself for outrage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is not much it can do beyond what has been done to stop bailed-out boards' noses going to the trough. RBS's catastrophic purchase of ABN Amro included contracts with traders to pay fixed bonuses regardless. A one-line bill in parliament denying them the cash can't be done: they would sue, and anyway, governments can't simply set aside contracts. Traders in many banks will claim bonuses for "success", because they work in foreign exchange and bond markets that do well when shares bucket. Stand back and watch the explosion of public indignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama's thundering words resounded around the world this week. He castigated "disgusting payoffs" and "lavish bonuses", fixing a $500,000 pay cap on bailed-out banks and firms. Is it heartening or depressing that Labour only dares echo such words when Obama has said them? It raised top tax two weeks after Obama won an election promising the same. After 12 years of celebrating the filthy rich, Peter Mandelson finally tells RBS to reconsider "exorbitant bonuses" and "how it looks and what public opinion will be".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is this nearly the end of the bonus culture? Not yet. Mandelson added the crucial rider: "Obviously you have to work in a market, you've got to recruit the best people and keep the best people in place and motivate them." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No change there, then. The rationale for runaway pay was market competition; but the crisis revealed they were not brilliant, just deluded group-thinkers harvesting bonuses in a rising market. Often, when meeting them, they seemed lacking in intellectual curiosity, ignorant about ordinary life, breathtakingly selfish, and to have testosterone where their brains should be. Ask the universities: those heading for the City are rarely the cleverest, just the greediest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responses to Obama's modest pay cap of $500,000 have been revealing. The chief executive of Deutsche Bank warned that US talent would flee the bailed-out banks: "Talent will be happy to work for us." But astute observers dismiss that as bravado - the mobility of these masters of the universe was always exaggerated. In Britain as elsewhere, few top CEOs are foreign and few foreigners want our "talent", as Work Foundation research proved. There never was a shortage of talent, just a tiny club of self-proclaimed silverbacks, head-hunted from one company to another for mushrooming inducements. And mass sackings make the "market" excuse weaker than ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more revealing is the warning to Obama that if bailed-out bank chiefs get no bonuses until they pay back state cash, they will stop lending in order to store capital for that payback. In other words, everything about bonuses creates perverse incentives. It motivated them to take insane risks with bonuses pegged to share price. It encouraged auditors to turn a blind eye. Now withholding bonuses will apparently make banks do wrong again, just as the no-bonus threat drove Barclays to borrow at exorbitant rates elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If nothing can be done about this year's bonuses, at next month's budget a white paper on bank regulation and Lord Turner's Financial Services Authority review will look to the future. Reforms will be proposed, but don't hold your breath for radicalism. Those giving advice are all in the game: Sir Philip Hampton, newly arrived to clean up RBS, is being paid &amp;pound;750,000 plus a &amp;pound;1.5m bonus for a part-time job on top of his Sainsbury's &amp;pound;450,000 part-time stipend, so where will culture change on remuneration be? New non-exec directors don't include sharp-eyed, lower-paid academics or heads of Oxfam, the research councils or other experienced institutions outside the Square Mile. You get no culture change from people who think earning a couple of million is as normal as tax avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What could be done? Abolish bonuses altogether. The evidence is that they don't work or have perverse effects. Performance-related pay demotivates losers without motivating winners. Changing the greed culture needs champions, so turn the Low Pay Commission, which sets the minimum wage, into a pay commission with a remit to set guidelines on the maximum shareholders should tolerate. Obama's $500,000 translates in the UK to 15 times the median pay of &amp;pound;23,000. That seems a generous maximum: CEO total pay packages have risen in the UK to 75 times the average pay within a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this budget Labour should consider reward from top to bottom. It would be the right time to raise the minimum wage. If inflation is likely to be zero or less, will benefits be adjusted accordingly? Labour should take steps to narrow the great income divide in this last chance to halve child poverty by 2010. That would cost &amp;pound;2.7bn - less than this month's City bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six opinion polls in a row give the Conservatives a lead with a 60- or 70-seat majority. It's easy to see why, as this crisis summons angry calls of "time for a change". It makes sense in the US, where politics and economics are in harmony. Obama arrives to clean up the explosive aftermath of Cheney-Bush neo-conomics. He reasserts the communal values of the state and public services, and the fairer distribution of rewards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the UK everything is out of joint. It should be Labour riding to the rescue after a Tory era of City excess, debt and bubble. The idea that the Tories can reinvent themselves as the nation's saviour from the City culture is bizarre. They are the City, and the City roots for them, however ardently Labour wooed its denizens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the outburst on bonuses this month signal a growing demand for a fairer sharing of pain and gain. If the Tories are the answer, what is the question? But "Throwing the rascals out" may be enough to get angry people to vote for them, despite pollsters finding little enthusiasm for Cameron and Osborne. So Labour has only a year to become the culture change voters seek. On bonuses, could it begin with the sound of Gordon Brown echoing other Obama words this week: "I screwed up"? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:polly.toynbee@guardian.co.uk"&gt;polly.toynbee@guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/executivesalaries"&gt;Executive salaries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/labour"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/obama-administration"&gt;Obama administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/gordon-brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/feb/07/surveillance-snitching-privacy-society</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/94608?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Comment+is+free%3A+We%27re+all+in+public+now&amp;ch=Comment+is+free&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Race+issues+%28News%29%2CBBC%2CTelevision+industry+%28Media%29%2CMedia%2CWorld+news&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CMedia+Weekly%2CTelevision+Media&amp;c6=Mark+Lawson&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1165185&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Comment+is+free&amp;c12=blog&amp;c13=&amp;c14=Comment+is+free&amp;h2=GU%2FComment+is+free%2Fblog%2FComment+is+free" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help me with a dilemma. Recently, in a private conversation, a top BBC presenter referred to a celebrated newscaster as a "dim Welsh bastard". On another occasion, during a heated exchange with a radio colleague over the decision not to screen the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal for Gaza, he suggested my position was inevitable given that I am Jewish - an allegation that, as has been mentioned on these pages before, would prove shattering to the Vatican.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the fact that it was misdirected does not make the remark any less potentially antisemitic. Should I then report such offensive comments to my line managers so these employees can be dealt with as Carol Thatcher was?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's clearly worse to refer to a black tennis player by the grossly offensive "golliwog" phrase than to connect a newscaster with the land of his fathers. But the more important issue in the Thatcher case is not the limits of acceptable language; it's the point at which it becomes acceptable to report a private comment to the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thatcher row reminds us that there are words that possess such historical toxicity that they should only be used with extreme forethought. But the incident provokes me to use a word I have always hesitated to use in print. That word is "Orwellian".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fallout over cheap wine at The One Show confirms a troubling sense of the development of a Snitch Britain, in which the zone of speech-policing is ever expanding. The football manager Ron Atkinson lost his job for a racist comment that he believed was off-air but was broadcast. Prince Harry got into trouble for unthinking bigotry on a tape intended for internal army consumption. Now an employee has gone for a comment neither recorded nor broadcast but simply snitched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the second member of the same family to suffer cries of "Thatcher out!" was not an isolated example. At the same time, the actor Christian Bale was embarrassed by the release of a recording of a rant against the incompetence of a movie colleague. The singer Miley Cyrus is under pressure to explain slitty-eyed gestures made in private photos posted on a website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can argue that these are people in the public eye who should know better but, as Thursday's House of Lords report on the "surveillance society" warned, everyone is now in the public eye: tracked as we walk the streets by 4m CCTV cameras protecting us from crimes for which we might then be arrested if our DNA is in the state database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least when we reach the office, we may be lost to surveillance - unless a colleague is training a mobile on us or reporting a remark. This is the way we live now. Until the arrival of thought-reading devices, everyone will have to live like a reality TV star, imagining a microphone roped round their neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living this carefully is a difficult adjustment to make. I know of a recent incident at a media company where a student was invited in on work experience, a common practice. This time, though, the intern went home and wrote a blog detailing every off-the-record comment, celebrity indiscretion and commercially sensitive detail she had witnessed in the office. She then posted the choicest bits on Popbitch. The employers were horrified; the student surprised at their surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was simply a generational clash. In concepts of privacy, the young live naked, the old stay clothed. Thatcher's problem was to be a double anachronism, trusting to the ancient broadcasting rule that what happens in the green room stays in the green room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But although her agent has invoked that tradition of post-show omerta in her defence, the truth is that few would trust these days to what it is now possibly risky to call Chinese walls. There was a time when unwinding cabinet ministers would whisper through the after-show smoke what they really thought of the PM, but a modern politician would visualise the internet waiting with cupped hands. This particular Thatcher, being merely the daughter of a politician, will not have had such antennae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consensus is that she could have got away with saying it at home; but how long will it before a case is brought over a remark heard through a wall? We can moralise about Thatcher and laugh at Bale but how many of us could survive a printout of every workplace rant we have ever had? Bigots should be challenged, but reporting is another matter. Golliwog is a nasty word, but so is snitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:comment@guardian.co.uk"&gt;comment@guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/race"&gt;Race issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/television"&gt;Television&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Around the world on shoestring</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2009/feb/07/rolf-potts-budget-travel-guide</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/31767?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Travel%3A+Around+the+world+on+shoestring&amp;ch=Travel&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Budget+travel%2CTravel%2CCuba+%28Travel%29%2CCzech+Republic+%28Travel%29%2CBangkok+%28Travel%29&amp;c5=European+Travel%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CAsia+Travel%2CCentral+America+and+Caribbean+Travel&amp;c6=Rolf+Potts&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1164715&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Travel&amp;c12=Budget+travel&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FTravel%2FBudget+travel" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever anyone asks me why I still travel on a shoestring at the ripe old age of 38, I usually tell them about the time I learned how to play the bagpipes in Havana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granted, I could probably relate a more typical story about the joys of budget travel - some tidy parable of money saved and experiences gained - but when I mention learning the bagpipes in Cuba it sounds like I'm going to tell a joke, and people like jokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing is, there's no punch line. My encounter with Cuban bagpipers wasn't memorable for its mere quirkiness - it was memorable because it illustrates how travelling on the cheap can offer you windows into a culture that go beyond the caricatured stereotype of what a place is supposed to be like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The travel caricature of Havana, of course, is an elegantly aged vision of cigars and classic cars, son and salsa, communist slogans and caf&amp;eacute; con leche. To actualise this vision, many upscale tourists head for the $120-a-night Hotel Nacional, a classic, mafia-era facility that features $8 mojitos and a lovely terrace looking out over the Malec&amp;oacute;n and the Straits of Florida. Unfortunately, most Cubans don't have access to the Hotel Nacional, and - as is the case with luxury hotels in many parts of the world - it tends to create a travel experience based more on the idea of how the city should be than how the city is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent my nights in Cuba just up the street from the Hotel Nacional, shelling out just $15 a night to sleep at a casa particulare homestay in Havana's leafy Vedado district. I couldn't see the Malec&amp;oacute;n from my bedroom, nor could I order room-service rum cocktails, but I did get to take part in the day-to-day home routine of my Cuban hosts. In the mornings I would have coffee with them and practise my Spanish; in the evenings we'd watch the state-run TV station, trying to spot bits of real news through the haze of official propaganda. My host family cheerfully introduced me to various friends and neighbours, and within a few days my little social network had offered me access to underground poetry readings, pickup baseball games, and - on one fateful afternoon - a bagpipe performance at the Asturian Federation in central Havana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where I come from in the United States, bagpipes are the pastime of earnest, middle-aged men with potbellies and Scottish surnames. In Havana, I discovered that bagpipes are the passion of wicked-smart twentysomething Havana University graduates with a love of music as deep and soulful as anyone portrayed in The Buena Vista Social Club. Instead of playing the Spanish guitar and African percussion that distinguish son music, however, these guys were channelling the Celtic rhythms of Spain's Asturias region, which sent tens of thousands of immigrants to Cuba in the late 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I befriended those hipster kids and began to learn how to play the gaita (an Asturian bagpipe with a single drone pipe), I discovered a side of Havana that was as authentically (if not stereotypically) a part of Cuba as baseball and rumba. Like the tourists in the Hotel Nacional, I still had plenty of access to son, cigars and salsa - but I also got to see a side of Havana that revealed the complexity of the city and its subcultures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying that you have to hang out with bagpipers if you really want to experience Havana; I'm just noting how spending less money has a way of paying off in original and memorable experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And shoestring travel is not just for long trips. Last summer, I travelled to the Czech Republic with my parents. We could have easily splurged on expensive hotels and guided tours during our time in Prague, but instead we bought a three-day tram-pass and checked into a hostel in the city's suburban Vinohrady district. Even though my parents are in their 60s, the youthful backpackers staying at the hostel treated them as one of their own, and offered travel advice on topics ranging from tourist destinations to experimental theatre to where one can sample the city's best absinthe. We ended up spending three days exploring various corners of the city on foot and by public transport. We stumbled across standard sights like Stare Mesto and the Charles bridge, of course, but we also happened upon children's school-jazz performances and a Czech Corvette-club rally. We admired the art nouveau styling of the Mayor's Hall, but we also marvelled at the casual art nouveau detailing in suburban post offices and pizza parlours. When we stopped into a random pub and used improvised hand signals to order Plzensky Prazdroj and knedliky, we felt as if we were the very first outsiders to discover the joys of Czech beer and dumplings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it sounds to you like I'm an ageing backpacker who never quite grew out of his shoestring ways, you'd be exactly right. In many ways, my travel sensibilities have grown out of a journey I took 10 years ago, when I quit my job as an English teacher and took a journey across Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. I probably had enough money saved up to invest in a three-month trip. As it turned out, I learned ways to stretch my travel budget into a life-enriching 30-month sojourn - and in all those months of travel, my day-to-day costs were significantly cheaper than day-to-day life would have cost me back in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secret to my extraordinary thrift was neither secret nor extraordinary: like many generations of backpackers and shoestring travellers before me, I was able to make my modest savings last by slowing down and forgoing a few comforts as I travelled. Instead of luxury hotels, I slept in clean, basic hotels, hostels and guesthouses. Instead of dining at fancy restaurants, I ate food from street vendors and local cafeterias. Occasionally, I travelled on foot, slept out under the stars, and dined for free at the stubborn insistence of local hosts. In what eventually amounted to over two years of travel, my lodging averaged out to just under $5 a night, my meals cost well under $1 a plate, and my total expenses rarely exceeded $1,000 a month. Instead of investing my travel budget in luxuries and amenities, I invested it in more travel time - and it never failed to pay off in amazing experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my favourite budget destination in the world is Bangkok. The city may be chaotic, traffic-snarled and incomprehensible, but it never fails to amaze me. Over the years I've found lodging in countless corners of the city - from the $4 backpacker dives of Khao San Road (which has gentrified a lot since my first visit in 1999) to the posh, five-star environs of the storied Mandarin Oriental Hotel. My favourite place to crash is the Atlanta Hotel, a curious little $15-a-night gem (complete with a courtyard swimming pool and an art-deco lobby) off on Sukhumvit Road. To the untrained eye, Sukhumvit Road could pass for a westernised strip of air-conditioned shopping malls and office buildings, but the area wears its globalisation in a distinctively Thai way. Sure, there are McDonalds and Starbuck franchises for those who choose to dine there, but there are also street vendors serving paad thai, fresh pineapple and grilled scorpion on a stick for pennies a serving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been almost eight years now since I finished that extended stint of vagabonding, but the experience is still very much a part of me. In financial terms, I have the resources to sleep in five-star hotels and eat in expensive international restaurants, but I've found I rarely choose such luxurious options. Given a choice between a $400-a-night hotel and an $18-a-night flophouse in Hong Kong, I tend to opt for the latter. Faced with the prospect of an all-inclusive dinner buffet in a Santo Domingo casino, I invariably find myself wandering outside to sample food from street vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the charm of budget travel has always been less about saving money than making the most of my time on the road. Travelling cheaply has forced me to be engaged and creative, rather than to throw money at my holidays and hope for the best. Freed from a rigid, expense-laden itinerary, I'm more likely to be spontaneous, embrace serendipity and enjoy each moment of my journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This notion of spending less and experiencing more holds true regardless of economic conditions, but in a time of global recession it makes even more urgent sense - not just for holidays, but for life in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Rolf Potts is author of Vagabonding, published by Random House, and Marco Polo Didn't Go There published by Travelers' Tales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/budget"&gt;Budget travel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/czechrepublic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/bangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

Book an apartment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might have to make your own bed, but at least you can lie in as long as you like. Increasingly, savvy travellers looking to offset the falling value of sterling are increasingly considering a holiday apartment rather than a hotel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic slowdown has also seen a torrent of properties originally bought as investments or second homes flood on to the holiday lettings market. And many of the established websites specialising in holiday apartments have upgraded their offerings in recent months, presenting potential renters with the range of accommodation and level of functionality they've come to expect when searching for hotels. In short, there's never been a better time to rent a holiday apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate Stinchcombe of &lt;a href="http://www.holidaylettings.co.uk"&gt;holidaylettings.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; says it has witnessed almost 50% growth in the amount of properties listed on its website in the past year, with the UK in particular seeing an astonishing 73% increase, resulting in a classic buyer's market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many are finding that they need to lower their prices to attract potential renters," adds Carol Mendelsohn, editor of &lt;a href="http://www.slowtrav.com"&gt;slowtrav.com&lt;/a&gt;, which advocates living like a local on holiday. Finding a suitable apartment is easy, she says, as several websites  are searchable by region and price and, increasingly, the big sites contain reviews written by recent visitors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marie and Jamie Dean from Hackney in east London rented an apartment during a trip to Tokyo over Christmas. Through the Japan Stay Club (&lt;a href="http://www.japanstayclub.com"&gt;japanstayclub.com&lt;/a&gt;) they found a third-storey apartment in a residential block in Ebisu for &amp;pound;600pw (including a "hidden" cleaning service charge), a quiet neighbourhood just two subway stops away from glamorous Shibuya Crossing. Staying in an apartment saved them money not only on accommodation, but also on overall living costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We ate out quite a lot," says Marie, "but enjoyed being able to cook our own meals, too, making the most of trips to local markets and food halls." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying in an apartment also allowed their trip to alternate between "one day exploring and the next day chilling", a godsend after a 14-hour flight, and gave them more space to relax and get a feel for neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say you do have to think carefully about the area you choose - hotels tend to be near transport connections, nightlife etc, though not all flats will be -  but they would definitely do it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another tip worth bearing in mind is to use a site with a rental guarantee that will reimburse you should anything go wrong with the booking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The downside of renting an apartment, particularly for those looking for city breaks, is that some owners still insist on a minimum of one-week rentals. But, just as hotels are prepared to haggle, apartment owners are increasingly willing to negotiate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And here's our pick of the best apartments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York from &amp;pound;67pn (sleeps two)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brownstone studio apartment  in up-and-coming Morningside Heights is a snip. With a sofa-bed in the living room, technically it could sleep four. &lt;br /&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.holiday-rentals.co.uk/p210889"&gt;holiday-rentals.co.uk/p210889&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paris from &amp;pound;553pw (sleeps four)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently refurbished apartment in fashionable Le Marais, it features attractive wooden furniture and an interior showing a clear affection for 60s modernism. The Place des Vosges is practically on your doorstep and the Picasso Museum a short saunter away.&lt;br /&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.ownersdirect.co.uk/france/FR4045.htm"&gt;ownersdirect.co.uk/france/FR4045.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;London &amp;pound;133pn (sleeps three)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't get many apartments in the City of London. Even fewer that you can rent for a city break. This smart Bishopsgate bolthole comes with a credit crunch price reduction. &lt;br /&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.holiday-velvet.com/london/london_apartments/details/central+executive+s/id/8373."&gt;holiday-velvet.com/london/london_apartments/details/central+executive+s/id/8373.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rome &amp;pound;624pw (sleeps two)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bright, handsomely furnished one-bedroom close to the Vatican. Features newly refurbished wooden floors and a terrace.  &lt;br /&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.friendlyrentals.com/en/apartments/rome/apartment-2610-220.htm"&gt;friendlyrentals.com/en/apartments/rome/apartment-2610-220.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miami &amp;pound;559pw (sleeps two)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a little bargain: located in the funky neighbourhood of Lincoln Road it comes with its own parking space and a late checkout of 6pm. &lt;br /&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.holidaylettings.co.uk/rentals/miami-beach/35879"&gt;holidaylettings.co.uk/rentals/miami-beach/35879&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venice &amp;pound;122pn (sleeps three)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An art-lover's crash pad: this large studio near the Peggy Guggenheim Museum combines exposed rafters with a Mondrian-inspired colour scheme. &lt;br /&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.holiday-velvet.com/venice/venice_apartments/details/guggenheim/id/164"&gt;holiday-velvet.com/venice/venice_apartments/details/guggenheim/id/164&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ibiza &amp;pound;893pn (sleeps six)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A superbly arranged, newly built, three-bedroom apartment overlooking the white sands of Playa d'en Bossa. Comes with its own rooftop pool. Near both Ibiza Town and the legendary nightclub Space. &lt;br /&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.holidaylettings.co.uk/rentals/ibiza-town/56422"&gt;holidaylettings.co.uk/rentals/ibiza-town/56422&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stockholm &amp;pound;63pn (sleeps two)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Swedish krona is one of the few currencies to have fared as badly as the pound, making Sweden, of all places, an increasingly affordable European destination. Save more of your money by staying in this quaint little 16th-century flat in heart of Gamla Stan, the old town. &lt;br /&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.travel-library.com/apartments/europe/sweden/stockholm/old_town_gamla_stan_stockholm_lh.html"&gt;travel-library.com/apartments/europe/sweden/stockholm/old_town_gamla_stan_stockholm_lh.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rio from &amp;pound;79pn (sleeps four)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Splendid views of the mountains overlooking Ipanema beach make this loft apartment a fabulous place to bask in the best of Rio. Minimalist interior and English-speaking owners. &lt;br /&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.travel-library.com/apartments/south_america/brazil/rio_de_janeiro/ipanema_loft.html"&gt;travel-library.com/apartments/south_america/brazil/rio_de_janeiro/ipanema_loft.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budapest from &amp;pound;297pw (sleeps four)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This impressive art nouveau suite (pictured below) is situated in the city's most salubrious quarter, close to the opera house and the famous music academy. Rooms at the Corinthia Grand Hotel Royal, directly opposite, average &amp;pound;400pn.   &lt;br /&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.holidaylettings.co.uk/rentals/budapest/67673"&gt;holidaylettings.co.uk/rentals/budapest/67673&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Ask for a no-frills alternative&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tour operators are taking a leaf out of the supermarkets' book by introducing value-brand holidays. Adventure operator Explore (0844 499 0901, &lt;a href="http://www.explore.co.uk"&gt;explore.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;), for example, has launched 13 Back to Basics trips, where "luxuries" have been stripped back to make the holidays more affordable. Its Spirit of the Incas tour for &amp;pound;1,595pp follows almost exactly the same itinerary (Cusco, Lake Titicaca and a train ride to Machu Picchu) as its existing Sacred Land of the Incas tour, which starts from &amp;pound;2,195pp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;pound;600 difference is due to more basic accommodation, use of local transport and because meals and some excursions are not included. In a similar move, Tribes (01728 685 971, &lt;a href="http://www.tribes.co.uk"&gt;tribes.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;) is launching a range of value holidays called Down to Earth (&lt;a href="http://www.down-to-earth-holidays.com"&gt;down-to-earth-holidays.com&lt;/a&gt;, will go live on 16 Feb), such as a week's Golden Triangle tour in India for &amp;pound;580pp (exc flights), using homestays instead of hotels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Haggle for a hotel &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotel rates are notoriously blurry. The rack rate quoted on a website is not necessarily the lowest rate available, so it is always worth contacting a hotel directly to ask what their best price is, and then asking whether that really is their best offer. In other words, you should haggle. We contacted several hotels in New York and each was prepared to offer deals that were significantly lower than the listed internet price. The W Hotel chain was prepared to shave 25% off one price - &amp;pound;360 down to &amp;pound;270 for two nights - citing a special offer that wasn't listed on the net. Even better, the Dylan Hotel (&lt;a href="http://www.dylanhotel.com"&gt;dylanhotel.com&lt;/a&gt;) in midtown Manhattan, offered us two nights for &amp;pound;245, when the listed price was &amp;pound;467. We found it helps if you are flexible with dates or have the nerve to book the hotel close to your departure.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Take a package&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only lazy, unadventurous types who can't be faffed to make their own holidays go for packages, right? Wrong. Conventional wisdom used to dictate that DIY holidays always came in cheaper, but with operators desperate to get bums on seats, there are some startlingly cheap package deals out there - especially if you're looking to book last-minute. The mercurial "I'll go anywhere" function on Lastminute .com's holidays section is currently churning out some crackers; when we looked, there were seven days' B&amp;B in Gambia from &amp;pound;399pp (departing 20 Feb), five-star all-inclusive Nile tours in Egypt from &amp;pound;529pp (23 Feb), and half-board Goa beach breaks (6 March) from &amp;pound;409pp, all including flights. On expedia.co.uk (0871 226 0808), deals include seven nights' B&amp;B in Cape Town for &amp;pound;625pp at the four-star St George's Hotel , including Qatar Airways  flights with from Heathrow via Doha, departing 23 Feb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Join the club&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of websites collate the cream of the crop, and then fix deals with the hotels to ensure the best prices. &lt;a href="http://www.I-escape.com"&gt;I-escape.com&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is a collection of guest houses and boutique hotels around the world with honest reviews that lay out pros and cons. It's worth keeping an eye on its special-offer section. At the moment the Hotel Salvia in Soller, Mallorca, is on sale for &amp;euro;125 per night, a 50% reduction (valid 1 March - 15 May). &lt;a href="http://www.designhotels.com"&gt;Designhotels.com&lt;/a&gt; has 176 properties on its books and promises to match the price of a hotel &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;if you find it cheaper elsewhere within 24 hours. You don't have to join, but membership is free and entitles you to discounts. The hotels on mrandmrs smith.com tend to be pricey, but basic membership, at &amp;pound;15 a year, means you hear about timely offers. Currently it has a two-nights' B&amp;B-for-the-price-of-one offer at Seaham Hall, County Durham, for &amp;pound;360pp. Travel Offers (&lt;a href="http://www.travel-offers.co.uk"&gt;travel-offers.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;) charges &amp;pound;44.95 to sign up, but members pay only for dinner and breakfast (ie the room is thrown in free) at more than 350 good UK hotels. Other sites worth bookmarking are: &lt;a href="http://www.travelintelligence.com"&gt;travelintelligence.com&lt;/a&gt;, a site founded by travel writers, among them AA Gill, and the American-based &lt;a href="http://www.tablethotels.com"&gt;tablethotels.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Swap your home &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the economy started to pinch, home-exchange sites have been doing a roaring trade. This is where holidaymakers swap homes (and often cars, sometimes even friends) with people in their destination-of-choice for a fixed period. Obviously, this saves heaps on accommodation. For example, if you live in Liverpool and want to go to New York for a week in April, you look for New Yorkers who want to visit Liverpool around that time, and get chatting. With the recent peak in membership, there are lots of new locations popping up day by day.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.homelink.org.uk"&gt;homelink.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Camp in the sun&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camping is a great budget option as long as the sun shines. For guaranteed dry weather, you have to go further afield. A new website, &lt;a href="http://www.goglamping.net"&gt;goglamping.net&lt;/a&gt; from the same stable as &lt;a href="http://www.holidaypad.net"&gt;holidaypad.net&lt;/a&gt;, is a great place to start. It features luxury sites cherrypicked from across the globe, including a desert campsite run by a nomadic family near Ouarzazate in Morocco (&amp;euro;28pp pn half board), pavilion tents with en-suite bathrooms and four-poster beds by the beach in Goa (&amp;pound;252 per tent per week, sleeps up to 6), and eco tents in the Australian outback (from A$87/&amp;pound;41 pp pn). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Go all-inclusive&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's 11am, it must be water polo ...  Believe it or not, it is possible to stay in an all-inclusive that doesn't involve being frog-marched to the pool for fun games, all-you-can-eat buffets and the feeling that you're actually imprisoned on holiday. Upmarket operator Carrier (0161-491 7650, &lt;a href="http://www.carrier.co.uk"&gt;carrier.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;) has seven nights at the Sani Beach Club in Halkidiki, for &amp;pound;875pp including all meals at any of the Sani Resort's restaurants, unlimited premium-brand drinks, British Airways flights from Gatwick and transfers. Captivating Cuba (08444 129917, &lt;a href="http://www.captivatingcuba.com"&gt;captivatingcuba.com&lt;/a&gt;) is offering seven nights at the five-star adult-only Hotel Melia Las Americas in Varadero for &amp;pound;875pp (saving &amp;pound;175pp) with Virgin flights from Gatwick, transfers and Visa (valid for departures 3 May-28 June). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Live it up in Vegas  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There aren't many things falling as fast as sterling, but according to hotels.com, accommodation prices in Sin City has dropped by 20% in a year as Americans tighten their belts. The three-star Stratosphere Tower on The Strip has dropped to an average of &amp;pound;30 a night (&lt;a href="http://www.hotels.com"&gt;hotels.com&lt;/a&gt;), Virgin (&lt;a href="http://www.virginholidays.co.uk"&gt;virginholidays.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;) has four nights inc flights for &amp;pound;515pp at the 3.5 star Excalibur Hotel and Casino before 28 Feb (online only), while Best at Las Vegas (&lt;a href="http://www.bestatlasvegasholidays.co.uk"&gt;bestatlasvegasholidays.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;) has five nights for the price of four until autumn. Three-star Circus Circus is currently &amp;pound;425 inc flights before 31 March, so you will arrive with a healthy wallet, even if you don't leave with one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. Become a courier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courier flights - where you get a reduced price ticket in return for assisting in the delivery of a package to a destination - are not as common as they once were, but nor have they disappeared altogether. British Airways currently offers courier tickets on flights to Tokyo and Bangkok (the latter is only available until this spring). Travel writer Gemma Exley has booked a trip to Japan for April - peak season - for &amp;pound;320, when the normal online fare for the same flight was &amp;pound;910. "As there's only one courier flight to each destination per day (only Tues to Sun for Bangkok), my friend is flying out on another ticket 24 hours later," she says. "But since no responsibilities are required on the return leg, we can travel back together." As for those responsibilities, you don't come into contact with the package, but on arrival, you are required to collect a loading note which you must then hand to customs officials. Availability was plentiful at the time of writing - even for flights this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• For more information call British Airways World Cargo on 0870 320 0301&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/budget"&gt;Budget travel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/selfcatering"&gt;Self-catering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/uk"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/newyork"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/rome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/miami"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/venice"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/stockholm"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/riodejaneiro"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/budapest"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Kaupthing sues Tchenguiz firm</title>

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/60123?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=World+news%3A+Kaupthing+sues+Tchenguiz+firm+for+%C2%A3643m&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Iceland+%28News%29%2CGlobal+economy+%28Business%29%2CBusiness%2CWorld+news&amp;c5=European+Travel%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CBusiness+Markets&amp;c6=Simon+Bowers%2CNick+Mathiason%2CDavid+Teather%2CJulia+Finch&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1165133&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=World+news&amp;c12=Iceland&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FWorld+news%2FIceland" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company linked to the property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz - whose investments include the Slug &amp; Lettuce and Yates's bar chains - is being sued by the collapsed Icelandic bank Kaupthing for an unpaid overdraft of &amp;pound;643m, according to a claim filed in a Reykjavik court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  claim highlights how deeply entangled Tchenguiz's highly leveraged investments became in a complex web of corporate loans and cross-holdings centred on the failed Icelandic bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaupthing is pressing ahead with the lawsuit despite a rushed sale of Tchenguiz's stakes in J Sainsbury and pub group Mitchells &amp; Butlers in October, designed to meet loan recall demands from the bank as it scrambled to avert its own crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disposals, along with other loan recalls, raised hundreds of millions of pounds but were not enough to prevent Kaupthing collapsing in the Icelandic banking meltdown. Tchenguiz is estimated to have personally lost more than &amp;pound;800m on the October share sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tchenguiz, speaking to the Guardian, said the firm which had the overdraft, Oscatello, has now been taken out of his ownership and is controlled by Kaupthing. He said that he had not been cited in any legal action. "For the elimination of doubt  Robert Tchenguiz is not being sued."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tycoon, one of the Monaco yacht set, has emerged as one of the credit crunch's most high-profile victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit against the Tchenguiz-linked company in Iceland claims the overdraft had been extended to Oscatello Investments, a British Virgin Islands holding company controlled by Tchenguiz, in December 2007. As collateral, Tchenguiz is believed to have put up direct and indirect investments in companies including Sainsbury's and M&amp;B, as well as shares in Exista, an Icelandic financial investment company. Details of the demand were disclosed yesterday in Iceland's Morgunbladid newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaupthing's loan recall is understood to have been partially met but the &amp;pound;643m is still outstanding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as owning shares in Exista, Tchenguiz is a director of the company with the executive chairman, Lydur Gudmundsson, one of Iceland's most influential businessmen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exista was the largest single shareholder in Kaupthing prior to the bank's collapse last October, owning about a quarter of its shares, a sign of how interlinked the businesses were. Shares in Exista are now almost worthless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creditor-appointed management at Kaupthing are seeking to find out why the credit approval committee at the bank approved the loan to Tchenguiz partly with indirect investments as collateral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of Tchenguiz's other ventures are deeply intertwined with Kaupthing. The Icelandic bank has debt and equity in Bay Restaurant Group, which includes restaurant chain La Tasca and Slug &amp; Lettuce, as well as Town &amp; Country, the parent company of the Yates's bar chain. The businesses were bought from administrators having been previously owned by Laurel Pub Company, a Tchenguiz-owned business that failed last March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tchenguiz's relationship with Kaupthing helped secure him a place alongside Barclays Capital and Apax in the private equity buyout of Somerfield, backed by large loans from the Icelandic bank. The  business was sold to the Co-op last autumn for &amp;pound;1.56bn, although the cash is not due to be paid until the end of this month. Tchenguiz believes his financial difficulties have been caused by Kaupthing's difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iranian-born Tchenguiz is known for opulent parties on his yacht in Cannes and dating the model Caprice. He is said to have introduced Princess Diana to Dodi Fayed. His father, reputedly the Shah of Iran's jeweller, gave Tchenguiz and his brother Vincent a large sum in the 1990s to buy an office building in Hammersmith. From that they created a huge property empire. Tchenguiz used his property assets as leverage to make a series of high-profile investments, even trying to buy the department store group Selfridges. The Globe pub chain, which he jointly owns with Scottish &amp; Newcastle and has 420 pubs, is also under pressure and in danger of breaching its banking covenants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Icelandic saga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iceland's three biggest banks - &lt;strong&gt;Glitnir,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Kaupthing&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Landsbanki&lt;/strong&gt; - all collapsed last October, putting at risk &lt;strong&gt;&amp;pound;15bn of deposits &lt;/strong&gt;from savers across Europe. The combined assets of the three banks were nine times the country's &lt;strong&gt;gross domestic product&lt;/strong&gt;. This meant the government and central bank could not afford to keep the banks afloat and were forced to turn to the &lt;strong&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/strong&gt; for a loan. Thousands of British savers were put in limbo by the collapse of the banks and saw savings in UK accounts run by the Icelandic banks &lt;strong&gt;frozen &lt;/strong&gt;amid doubts over whether they would qualify for compensation. This led to a &lt;strong&gt;diplomatic row&lt;/strong&gt; between the British and Icelandic governments. However, savers have since been &lt;strong&gt;compensated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iceland"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/global-economy"&gt;Global economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Price of carbon credits slumps again</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/feb/07/cost-carbon-credits-falls</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/20476?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Environment%3A+Price+of+carbon+credits+slumps+to+new+low&amp;ch=Environment&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Carbon+emissions+%28Environment%29%2CCarbon+offsetting+%28Environment%29%2CPollution+%28Environment%29%2CEnvironment%2CGlobal+economy+%28Business%29%2CBusiness%2CWorld+news&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CBusiness+Markets%2CEthical+Living&amp;c6=Terry+Macalister&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1165128&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Environment&amp;c12=Carbon+emissions&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FEnvironment%2FCarbon+emissions" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price of carbon has hit new lows as power generators and industrial companies continue to cash in credits to bolster their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price of European Union allowances under the second phase of the emissions trading scheme has plunged to &amp;euro;10.15 (&amp;pound;8.85) a tonne, compared with highs over &amp;euro;30 seen in July last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Barclays Capital warned the price could fall further to &amp;euro;9 and Utilyx, the carbon information provider, said: "There seems to be no bottom to carbon prices at the moment." Market experts blame the decline on profit-taking and a collapse in manufacturing, which plunged in Britain at the end of last year at its fastest rate since the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power generators and industrial firms are selling off their credits to raise cash but also because they are confident they will not need so many pollution permits at a time of falling demand for their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline in emissions is good for global warming but it also means that offset projects, in which companies invest in green schemes to counter the impact of their carbon production, are being cut back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slump in the price of credits under the ETS will also revive criticisms that the cap and trade scheme has turned carbon into another volatile market commodity used by speculators to make money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF Energy, told the Guardian last week that the operations of the emissions trading scheme needed to be reviewed by Brussels before carbon was turned into a "sub-prime tool" by unscrupulous companies instead of doing the job it was set up for: reducing CO2 emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDF, the power company 85% owned by the French state, admitted it had sold some of its carbon credits on the market but only in very small numbers with the rest being transferred for use around the group's other overseas businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research paper published by the environmental group WWF in combination with the Point Carbon consultancy last spring claimed that windfall profits of up to &amp;euro;70bn could be made by the power groups in the course of phase two of the scheme, which runs from 2008 to 2012. They pointed out that there would have to be a high carbon price to achieve those particular financial gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanjeev Kumar, emissions trading scheme co-ordinator at the WWF, warned: "The way the national allocations plans are set up is a disaster. Handing free permits to power companies is like handing them a cash bonus." He added that "cheap profits for doing nothing is scandalous". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank and others predict carbon prices will rise again as industrial production picks up and the EU tightens the regulation on allowances, especially for phase three of the scheme, to run to 2020. But analysts have been consistently wrong about the direction of carbon prices, predicting 12 months ago that they would double from &amp;euro;22 a tonne to over &amp;euro;40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one had thought the price of carbon would drop to nearly zero in the first phase of the scheme, when the credits were all given out free, but since then some credits have been auctioned to the highest bidder. The auction system is expected to be used even more heavily in the third phase, which is still going through the political approval process in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama's new US administration is considering whether to set up its own federal carbon emissions trading scheme, in another step towards a global trading scheme, but critics say all these projects should be halted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/carbon-emissions"&gt;Carbon emissions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/carbon-offset-projects"&gt;Carbon offsetting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/pollution"&gt;Pollution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/global-economy"&gt;Global economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Perils on the road to PR-reviewed data</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/feb/07/bad-science-accidents-statistics</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/569?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Comment+is+free%3A+Perils+on+the+road+to+PR-reviewed+data&amp;ch=Comment+is+free&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Science&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Ben+Goldacre&amp;c7=2009_02_07&amp;c8=1165145&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Comment+is+free&amp;c12=blog&amp;c13=&amp;c14=Comment+is+free&amp;h2=GU%2FComment+is+free%2Fblog%2FComment+is+free" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of people who spend their time thinking about evidence and risk, I've always fantasised that the insurance industry must possess a vast repository of useful data: the experience of centuries, carefully tabulated by actuaries into secret commercial databases containing a truth about human behaviour and risk that most epidemiologists and social scientists would kill for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, for example, is the insurance company LV, which has managed to get its important road safety data analysis on to GMTV: "Mounting financial pressures have led to a surge in inexperienced cyclists taking to the roads," says LV in its press release. "Resulting in a 29% increase in road accidents involving cyclists in the past six months." It's topical, it involves death and fear, it's dressed in the cloak of statistical authority: this is totally going on the telly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing to note is that LV was comparing accidents in the six months leading up to November 2008 against accidents in the six months prior to that. What these insurance geniuses have failed to account for here, we might reasonably suspect, is the well-documented seasonal variation in road traffic incidents, since fewer people cycle in winter. I shall not be buying shares in this insurance company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But LV has created a small anecdotal window into how wrong survey data can be, by giving us figures that we can compare directly against those created with other, probably better methods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LV paid YouGov to sample 2,193 adults in November 2008, using an online questionnaire. It starts by announcing that 43% of adults cycle, which sounds rather high to me. The General Household Survey is produced by the Office of National Statistics. It doggedly interviews all the adults in a random sample of 13,000 addresses, face to face, asking them a huge number of questions in great detail. The latest GHS reckons that 19% have cycled once in the past year, and 9% in the past four weeks. So YouGov and LV Insurance with their online questionnaire are disagreeing by a factor of four already.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of these," LV goes on, "11% have been involved in an accident, 7% of these took place in the last six months = 150,434 accidents." We will move to the published accident figures from the Department for Transport (whose website has contained not a single use of the word "snow" this week, rather brilliantly). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were, according to the most recent figures from DfT, 16,230 accidents in the year from October 2007 to September 2008, so YouGov's online questionnaire disagrees this time by a factor of 10. You might speculate that DfT data is prone to under-reporting, and I would agree, but I trust this imperfect data more than I trust the opinion of a PR person who misses barn-door seasonal variation and seriously reckons half of you cycle. Also, most of those accidents reported to the DfT were minor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God I'm boring. Meanwhile, the Cyclists Touring Club, which certainly sounds like a dapper bunch, has collected data that shows a 91% increase in cycling in London since 2000. We can also go back through the historical DfT tables which show that there was in fact a 1% rise in accidents comparing the most recent quarter, July to September 2008, with the same quarter in 2007. When compared against the average of 1994-1998, by DfT data, bicycle accidents have fallen by 33%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it seems accidents have gradually gone down by a third over 10 years, but LV insurance and YouGov - using something my colleague Charlton Brooker has helpfully termed "PR-reviewed scientific evidence" - say accidents have gone up by a third in just six months, using data that forgets to account for the usual seasonal variation, and seems to get the prevalence of both cycling and accidents wrong, by an order of magnitude. Most importantly, this gets on the telly, with a nice puff for the LV brand, despite the fact that almost everything I have told you was spelled out to GMTV by the boys and girls in tweed at the CTC before it went to air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, there is nothing complicated here, and I will not be charging for courses, vitamin pills, or secret lifestyle programmes: eat fruit and veg, avoid excess alcohol and cigarettes, ride your bike to work, and ignore everything you see in the media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Please send your bad science to &lt;a href="mailto:ben@badscience.net"&gt;ben@badscience.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;
